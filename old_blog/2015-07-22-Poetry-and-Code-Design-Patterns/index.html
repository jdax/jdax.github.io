          <p>I went to a small liberal arts college with a unique approach to ensuring a well-rounded education. At Allegheny, there are three over-arching departments: Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences. Humanities includes history, English, Spanish, French, German, music, art, and other similar disciplines. Social Sciences were Psychology, Political Science, Economics, and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality studies and other related fields. Natural Sciences were Biology, Math, Physics, and other related fields. In order to graduate, you had to have a major in one department, a minor in another, and take at least 8 credits in the remaining department. I ended up with a major in Political Science, a minor in the Creative Writing: Poetry track, and I took astronomy and environmental science as my natural science courses. My electives were mostly philosophy and music courses. No, I had no intention of ever having a career that would allow me to pay off my student debt, why do you ask? Writing villanelles about mutually assured destruction is a PASSION.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I get asked a lot about how those skills do or do not translate to writing code. When it comes to political science? I've got nothing, sorry. I'll think on it and get back to you, but, for now, I like to believe that studying poetry directly maps to having a solid toolset for responsible code design and planning.</p>

<p>When you decide to write a poem, you must decide at the start what the structure will be. You cannot pick at random. You cannot decide that you are writing a love poem, and think "tercets will work." You see, tercets are always going to be associated with Dante, and therefore, with descent into hell. You might pick tercets if this is a love gone horribly wrong poem. But if this is your standard "head over heels" love poem, and you pick tercets just because, people are going to think you don't know your medium very well. And you don't. You need to know what the rules are before you can meaningfully break them.</p>

<p>When you decide to make a site, you must decide what the structure will be. You cannot pick at random. You cannot decide to make a static site and think "a rails application will work." Rails apps are always going to need databases and written for CRUD. You might choose a rails app if you want to try to make a blog, but if this is a standard static site with static content and you pick Rails just because, people will think you don't know your medium very well. And you don't, you need to know what the rules are before you can meaningfully break them.</p>

<p>The thing with poetry is that every word must play it's role to the fullest. Every enjambment must have a purpose. There are many rules in poetry, and many traditions. Not being aware of them can lead to a poem that misses its mark. For many poem structures, there are a set number of lines and syllables. You have to be concise, you have to pick words that fullfill the meaning of the poem, and also fit the structure, the meter.</p>
