		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't want my cashier to have the final say in whether I get emergency contraception, or a pregnancy.

If the Obama Administration requires EC be sold over the counter to those 15 and over, requiring an ID check by the cashier, then the anti-choice crowd will push to give cashiers the same "rights" they gave pharmacists. The "right" to interfere in a persons private decisions regard the use of their uterus. Pharmacists can simply say "I don't believe in EC" and leave a cis woman or trans man or any other person for whom the possibility to get pregnant exists frantic to find another pharmacy in which to purchase the EC, while the clock is ticking.

I am sure the anti-choice crowd are already brewing up legislation that would allow a cashier to refuse to ring up a pack of EC, claiming it's compromising their morals by "participating in abortion" (even though EC isn't abortion).

This might allow the expansion of "conscience clauses" to cashiers to deny to ring up not just EC, but refuse to sell nail polish, or caffeinated beverages, or cigarettes, or any other number of products, to a cis woman or trans man they even suspect <em>may </em>be pregnant. I don't want a cashier to have that much power. That isn't protecting the cashiers right to religion. That is giving the cashier a right to force <em>their</em> beliefs onto me. That is an invasion of <em>my</em> religion or lack thereof.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(F/D I was in an abusive relationship for a year and a half.)

Content note: discussion of violence and abuse.

I can only speak to my own experiences, and I do not want to speak over anyone else. Please check out the National Domestic Violence Hotline and RAINN for resources near you.

1.) Don't tell us we should leave. We know we should. Often we do not feel it is safe to do so. Instead tell us you are there for us if we need you. You can tell us you support what ever decision we make, and can offer a couch or a shoulder.

2.) Don't tell us you don't like our partners. We see ourselves as an extension of our partner, and therefore we interpret this attack in our partner and our relationship as an attack on us.

3.) Don't tell us you dont like the way he treats us. We interpret this as an attack on our ability to be treated well. We start thinking about what we did to deserve ill treatment.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On Comment Policies and Free Speech</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Blogs are like small independent newspapers run out of your basement. You usually only get enough printed for you family + 20, and hope that your family passes out the copies you printed. Someday you might get big, and you might be able to add some ad space, but for now, you can't. You just write what you want to write, not concerned about subscriptions or revenue.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="222"]<a href="http://cdn.morguefile.com/imageData/public/files/c/caprisco/02/l/136000087456h8z.jpg"><img class=" " src="http://cdn.morguefile.com/imageData/public/files/c/caprisco/02/l/136000087456h8z.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="147" /></a> this is your blog, but with less paper (via http://morguefile.com : by caprisco)[/caption]

No one is required to read this newspaper, or that newspaper, so if you don't want to read it, you can just toss it in the street if someone hands it to you (don't do that, please recycle!) and be on your way. No one is forcing you to read this blog, or any other blog. Most newspapers have letters to the editor and opinion sections. Blogs have comment sections. No newspaper can print every single op-ed or LTE. There isn't enough space. The internet, or blogs, have unlimited space though... So should blogs be required to publish every comment?

<!--more-->

No, resoundingly, no. Just as editors at newspapers throw out the op-eds with poor grammar, or that are threatening or extremely disrespectful, blogs must and should edit for quality. Further, I am the Editor in Chief of this blog, so I can decide what stays and what goes on any criteria I deem important.

Is this impinging upon someone's free speech rights? Now, I blog from the United States, and I realize that not every nation has "1st Amendment" rights, or an equivalent thereof in the system of governance. Since I live in the US, and since it is the place in which I must follow the laws, I shall write specifically upon it. Please feel free to use my work to create your own analogy for the legal system in which you participate if you so choose.

Anyway, here is the 1st Amendment, for clarity's sake:
<blockquote><em><strong>Congress shall make no law respecting</strong> an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; <strong>or abridging the freedom of speech</strong>, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. (emphasis mine)
</em></blockquote>
Ok. So, it says that Congress, that is, the Congress of the United States, ie, the federal government, cannot make any law restricting freedom of speech. It's been further extrapolated in various Supreme Court cases to also mean that the government cannot compel speech. What does this mean for your comment policy? It means that unless you are the entirety of the US government, you can do what ever the fuck you like. The 1st Amendment protects you, dear reader and maybe commenter, from the government silencing you or forcing you to say things you don't want to say. It says nothing about me, the Editor in Chief of my personal blog deleting untoward comments. The 1st Amendment says you can shout all you want about whatever you want in the public square, but it does not say that people must sit there and listen to you. The 1st Amendment says you can write all the LTE's you want. It says nowhere that the Editorial board must publish it. You are entitled to speak all you want, you are not entitled to an audience.

So, this is my newspaper. Read it, or recycle it. Write a comment. But don't expect me to publish it. If the Constitution said it was illegal to delete comments, it would not be an available function on all blogging platforms.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Or, "Why Ladies Night isn't 'Female Privilege'"

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="222"]<img src="http://mrg.bz/pDUAt1" alt="" width="222" height="335" /> (from morguefile.com, by Seemann, http://mrg.bz/xAGKpy)[/caption]

If you hang around in the MRA section of reddit long enough, you will eventually see a man complaining about all us feminists that expect men to pay all the time. Later, this same MRA will claim feminists are emasculating him by not letting him pay. Later still, he will complain about "ladies nights" at bars, and why do women get free drinks all the time and men don't?

Well, Mr. MRA, I hope I have a sound answer for you.

<!--more-->

Once upon a time (most) women were not allowed to have paying jobs in the United States. Women were not allowed to own property, or possess money. If a woman wanted to go out to dinner with a man, he had to pay. This was seen as benevolent sexism. Yes, women were oppressed, but it was kindly, it was done because men loved us so much they wanted to protect us from the evil world of money, politics, work, as it would damage our precious souls and we would be less pure in our childbearing and rearing. We were the angels in the domicile.

Eventually, we were allowed to have jobs, but our paychecks had to be signed over to our fathers, husbands, or other male guardian. So, we still had to rely on men to take us out to dinner.

Eventually, this became a cultural standard, at first based on necessity, and later, seen as a sign of a true gentlemen. Women still make a fraction of what men make, all for doing the same work, and doing it at the same level of competency. It was seen as chivalry, but many many feminists said "No, we can pay for our own dinners!" and so "dutch dates" were born. These dates are commonly regarded as "not real dates" by many cultural commentators, seen as less than, with men being told their masculinity is in question, and women being told they are too forward or too radical. (Yet, at the same time, women who let men pay for the dates are often called "golddiggers" or are told we are just with him "for his money" - no, we can never win.)

So, this leads to the question of how can we have dates were men can keep their masculinity in tack - by having enough money to pay the bill - and have women not seem too forward or too stingy? Ladies Nights.

These nights are not to benefit women, they exist to help men get women drunk enough to score without breaking the bank. These nights ensure that a bunch of ladies show up in order for men to have a greater pick then they normally would. And they ensure that none of these men have to actually pay for the alcohol that he would ideally like the woman to imbibe in great amounts.

Ladies Nights exist to facilitate date rape. Yes, women get drinks for free, meaning that men get to have women be extremely drunk without having to say "Let me get you a drink."]]></content:encoded>

<div style="background-color:white;height:auto;margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;max-width:535px;"><i><span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;line-height:17px;">This post was <a href="http://www.amplifyyourvoice.org/u/nikki_liz/2012/3/7/Virginias-Ultrasound-Laws-Young-Women-Must-Continue-To-Be-Heard" target="_blank">originally</a> published on Amplify Your Voice. I am currently interning with Advocates for Youth, and blogging on state policy is one of my duties.</span></span></i></div>
<div style="background-color:white;font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;height:auto;line-height:17px;margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;max-width:535px;"></div>
<div style="background-color:white;font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;height:auto;line-height:17px;margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;max-width:535px;">On Saturday, March 3, <a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/more-than-30-arrested-at-anti-abortion-rally-in-richmond/2012/03/03/gIQAWFyJpR_blog.html">protestors met in Richmond, VA</a> to show their anger at the mandatory ultrasound law. This law would require women in Virginia who are seeking abortion to obtain an ultrasound twenty four hours in advance of the procedure, and to have the doctor describe it to them in detail.<br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />Antichoice lawmakers, and antichoice lobbyists, often test legislation in one or two states, see what they can and cannot get passed, figure out what kind of climate that law needs to be in to pass, and then have it exported to other states. This is what is happening all over right now, as the climate is right for these bills to pass. Last year roughly <a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2011/07/13/index.html">80 laws which restricted abortion access were passed at the state level. </a></div>
<div style="background-color:white;font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;height:auto;line-height:17px;margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;max-width:535px;"></div>
<div style="background-color:white;font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;height:auto;line-height:17px;margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;max-width:535px;"><!--more--><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />The momentum is continuing this year with the ultrasound laws. Antichoice advocates frame the ultrasound as a harmless procedure, and use faux-feminist empowerment language to sell it. Often this language is paternalistic and has an underlying assumption that women do not know what abortion is, don’t think about it, and are not aware of what pregnancy is. They try to fame it as “A Woman’s Right To Know,” or making sure women are able to give “informed consent,” and ensuring that women have “all the facts.” Right to know what? That she is terminating a pregnancy? They underlying assumption is that women just walk into abortion clinics without really knowing what they are there for. It’s insulting to women, and to the people who trust them. <a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/US-Abortion-Patients.pdf">60% of women seeking abortion have given birth at least once</a>. They know what pregnancy is. <br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />The Virginia ultrasound law was imported from <a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/14/us-texas-abortion-idUSTRE80C2BD20120114">Texas, where it is in effect, but still being held up in court on challenges</a>. The specific language of the bill, at first, required that the best possible picture for the ultrasound be obtained. For women in their first trimester (<a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_induced_abortion.html">when most abortions occur</a>), this would mean they would have to be subjected to an invasive transvaginal ultrasound, instead of the transabdominal (the “jelly on the belly” ultrasound that most people think of), and that the image be described to them in detail by their doctor. The language of the bill was modified so that the transvaginal would be optional, but an ultrasound of some sort would still be required.<br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />The <a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.acog.org/">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>, as well as the <a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.prochoice.org/">National Abortion Federation</a>, both agree that it is medically unnecessary for a woman seeking a first trimester abortion receive an ultrasound, unless the physician has cause to believe that there might be complications, or if the pregnancy cannot be accurately dated using the woman’s last menstrual period or other measures. <br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />These bills, the first of which went into effect in 1996 in Utah, seek to shame and humiliate women seeking abortion. <a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_RFU.pdf">Currently 11 states have laws regarding ultrasounds</a> prior to abortions. They range from requiring that doctors offer it, to the Virginia law which requires a description. Most recent studies (<a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19340704">one published in 2009</a>, and one currently being conducted by the <a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/02/06/study-ultrasounds-dont-stop-planned-abortions/">University of California San Francisco</a>) found that women do not change their minds upon viewing of the ultrasound. Researchers from both suggest that an ultrasound be offered, but none of the women in the 2009 study changed their minds, and preliminary results from the current study are finding the same thing. <br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />These laws seek to dictate medical practice to doctors; putting the legislature directly into the procedure room, and dictate to women that what they are doing is shameful and they should be punished.<br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />Ultrasound laws usually require, as is the case in Virginia and Texas, that it be done 24 hours in advance of the abortion. This requires the woman to make two appointments, take two days off from work, arrange childcare for those two visits, if she lives far away she must also arrange lodging, and to accept these extra costs, and the lost wages as well. For low income women, this is an undue burden. <br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><img src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_296w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/virginia-politics/Images/Abortion_Protest_Arrests_035eb.jpg?uuid=h9UnamV9EeGi8kaOgZ8ndw" alt="AP Photo/Richmond Times-Dispatch, Eva Russo" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />(AP Photo/Richmond Times-Dispatch, Eva Russo)<br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />This is why women of Virginia protested on Saturday. And they were arrested.<br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />Many of these protestors were young women, for some this might have been the first time they had to stand up for their rights. Many young people did not think we would have to continue the fight of our mothers and grandmothers. They fought that battle for us, and we became the women who always had abortion and birth control available for us. <br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;height:auto;max-width:535px;outline-color:initial;outline-style:initial;outline-width:0;" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dems-say-va-abortion-rights-protesters-were-intimidated-gop-defends-state-capitol-police/2012/03/05/gIQAvqRwsR_story.html">According to the police list, the median age of those arrested was 26 years old, with the youngest arrested being 19 years old. </a><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" /><br style="height:auto;max-width:535px;" />Continuing the recent trend of using unnecessary force to remove and silence protestors, these young women were met with police in riot gear, bearing rifles. They were loaded into the back of a converted school buses with barred windows. According to police, this was the first mass arrest in 26 years.</div>
<blockquote style="background-attachment:scroll;background-clip:initial;background-color:white;background-image:none;background-origin:initial;background-position:0 0;background-repeat:repeat repeat;border-image:initial;color:#222222;font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;height:auto;line-height:17px;max-width:535px;margin:10px 25px;padding:10px 20px;border:1px dotted #ffcc00;">
<div style="height:auto;max-width:535px;margin:0;padding:0;">“They were marching and chanting for women’s rights, and what did they face? SWAT teams, state police in full riot gear, police armed with semiautomatic guns and dogs — dogs. Not since the massive resistance days of the 1960s have I seen such a disgraceful display of excessive police presence.” - Sen. Janet D. Howell</div></blockquote>
<span style="background-color:white;font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;line-height:17px;">The verbal attacks on Sandra Fluke, a young woman who spoke up about birth control access, by Rush Limbaugh, and the twitter attacks by Patricia Heaton, combined with this show of police hostility, shows that society is uncomfortable with young women speaking up. Society does not like that us young women are getting angry about the gradual erosion of our rights.</span><br style="background-color:white;font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;height:auto;line-height:17px;max-width:535px;" /><br style="background-color:white;font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;height:auto;line-height:17px;max-width:535px;" /><span style="background-color:white;font-family:'Trebuchet MS', verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;line-height:17px;">But we need to continue to speak up, be heard, and fight. I never thought we would have to fight this battle again, but we cannot allow the police, or public figures to intimidate or silence us. </span>

		<title>Reproductive Justice and Reducing the Number of Abortions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;">

[Authors Note: I started this blog post on an older blog and imported the draft here. I am addressing a few points, but know there are many more. Further, I want to acknowledge that it is not just ciswomen who can get pregnant, but also trans-men, and those who are genderqueer or gender-non-conforming. Futher, not all families consist of two care caretakers, and caretakers can be of any or no gender.]

</div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;"></div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;">

It really bugs me when I am escorting, and see protestors trying to convince a person who is pregnant to rethink their decision to have an abortion. Believe me, these people have thought long and hard about this, and it is insulting when others insist that these people have not thought about it at all.

</div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;"></div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;">

Unfortunately, these are the same people who think that women have children just to get more food stamps. I hope that this list finds it way to some of those people, so they can find out the most effective ways of preventing abortion. [Hint: it is not by passing arcane laws that stipulate waiting periods of ridiculous length and forcing people who are pregnant and seeking abortion care to listen to lectures on Jesus, you know you you are.]

</div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;"></div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;">

I have made a list of some of the goals of the reproductive justice movement, which, if implemented, would actually dramatically reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, and hence, the number of abortions. <a href="http://www.sistersong.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=141&amp;Itemid=81">Many </a><a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/02/08/communicating-complexity-reproductive-justice/">people</a> have <a href="http://www.now.org/nnt/fall-2006/reproductive_justice.html">tried</a> to <a href="http://www.trustblackwomen.org/our-work/what-is-reproductive-justice/9-what-is-reproductive-justice">define </a><a href="http://www.sparkrj.org/about/what-is-reproductive-justice/">reproductive</a> <a href="http://www.safercampus.org/blog/2008/04/a-brief-history-of-the-reproductive-justice-movement/">justice</a>, and I believe that it encompasses the whole person, and most importantly, having people be able to make reproductive choices completely and fully, without being pressured by outside injustices, such as lack of access, lack of finances, or stigma.

</div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;"></div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;">

To be clear, I don't think there is a "good" number of abortions, there should be as many abortions as are needed. Saying we need less implies that abortion should be limited, and therefore stigmatized. Abortion is neutral, it is a medical procedure. We don't go saying there should be less of this medical procedure or that medical procedure. But, we should work to create less unintended pregnancies, and help people who want to continue a pregnancy be able to do so, just as we should work to make sure people who need to terminate pregnancies are able to do so.

</div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;"><!--more--></div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;"></div>
<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;">

1.) <strong>Comprehensive sex education.</strong> This is always at the top of any list. If people are having sex with condoms, the likely hood they will get pregnant within the year is roughly 15%. The Pill, if taken like a human (meaning you make mistakes), is 93% effective at preventing pregnancy. <a href="http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487">If we teach people how to use these methods of birth control, how to use them effectively, how to figure out which form of birth control is right for them, then we decrease the number of people who find themselves with unintended pregnancies</a>. If people aren't getting pregnant unintentionally, then those people don't need abortions.  Another part of comprehensive sex education should be learning how to treat your partner with respect, and not making demands on them for sex if they feel uncomfortable with it. A part of comprehensive sex education should be teaching them how to know if they are having sex for the right reasons, and not because of pressure from other people.

2.) <strong>Paid maternity leave with job security. </strong>Oops, you find yourself being that odd statistic out. You are one of those 7 people out of 100 that gets pregnant while on the pill.  What is one of your first concerns? Probably if you can take the 2 weeks before you deliver off of work, or if your boss is going to freak out and just fire you. If you have a cool boss, your next questions is if you can afford to take those two weeks off, and the subsequent weeks after that you will want to take off. Can you schedule prenatal appointments around your work schedule? If not, can you take that time off? Can you go a month without a pay check? Probably not. If people did not have to worry about whether being pregnant would cost them their job, and were assured a pay check while taking off, the financial burden of having a child would not be so great. More people would feel confident that they could take off of work to see the OB/GYN and make sure the pregnancy is healthy. More people would feel confident that they could take the time off to bond with the child, and still be able to afford to feed the child.  We need to<a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-06/features/ct-biz-0507-work-advice-huppke-20120506_1_national-partnership-women-families-women-and-work"> start passing laws that mandate that all employers provide their employees with paid maternity and paternity leave,</a> with their job security assured while they are away.

3.) <strong>Free pre-/post-natal care. </strong>A person who is pregnant is often shamed if they do not take their pre-natal vitamins every single day, with their ability to parent called into question. Women are called horrible mothers if they don't see the OB/GYN with regular frequency while pregnant. But some people also have jobs that don't allow them any time off to do so, or have jobs that don't pay them enough to be able to afford the luxuries of vitamins.<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-agin/health-care-and-the-unbor_b_253068.html"> If we have a system set up that allowed a person who is pregnant free access to pre and post natal care</a>, people would not be intimidated by a pregnancy and the huge cost of being pregnant. <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/04/08/newsflash-pregnancy-is-hard-but-anti-choicers-refuse-to-admit-it/">Pregnancy is not a walk in the park, it can have huge health risks, and devastating consequences if something goes wrong</a>. It is a medical condition that needs to be monitored.

4.) <strong>Improved funding for programs like WIC and SCHIP.</strong> If you expect a person who is pregnant to carry to term, even when s/he/ze demonstrates that s/he/ze does not have the financial means to do so, you better be advocating for WIC and SCHIP. These programs help the parent provide for the child. So, again, you think the fetus is a precious life, you better help protect that precious life when it is outside of the womb. If a parent is struggling to pay rent, and working two jobs, the least that can be done is to make sure "paying for a doctors visit for my child" and "paying for baby food" are not two of the worries. If s/he/ze has to worry about these things, or knows that if s/he/ze continues the pregnancy s/he/ze will have to worry about these things, s/he/ze is not going to want to continue the pregnancy. They know that they cannot provide for children at this time. So they abort, and wait until they are financially sound enough to shower a future child with love and gifts. If we took some of the stress of providing doctors visits and food off of the person who is pregnant or parenting, they would probably be less likely to abort, knowing that their potential child will have the basics.

5.) <strong>Free day/night care.</strong> Parents have to work. I know parents who go to work every day, and paying for day care takes half of their paycheck. And these are parents who are taking their children to the cheapest of the cheap day care. Having free day/night care would allow parents to make sure all of their paycheck goes toward taking care of the child. Not every parent can take her child to a grandparent, or a sister, or an aunt. Better yet, make sure every single company provides a day care. Yes, even McDonalds. A person who is facing an unintended pregnancy will wonder if s/he/ze can still work. But s/he/ze has to work if s/he/ze wants to pay for a child. But at the same time, can s/he/ze really afford daycare? Even if she works 16 hours a day?  I reiterate, most abortions happen because the person who is pregnant says they cannot afford to have a child. S/he/ze isn't being selfish. S/he/ze is thinking of that potential child, and if it will have a good life. If we provide people in these situations with job security, paid leave, free day care, and financial assistance for food and health care, then maybe more people who would want to continue a pregnancy to term, would be able to do so.

6.) <strong>End discrimination against pregnant people. </strong><a title="It exists." href="http://www.lectlaw.com/files/emp31.htm" target="_blank">It exists</a>, and it is a lot more than having someone look at your belly, and then immediately look for a ring. Pregnant people need to have rights.  Otherwise, they are fired or asked to have an abortion.<a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/05/01/two-legal-settlements-highlight-pervasive-problem-of-pregnancy-discrimination/"> Pregnant people face harsh working conditions and hostile employers</a>. According to a <a title="recent study" href="http://worklifelaw.org/pubs/PoorPregnantAndFired.pdf" target="_blank">recent study</a> by Center for WorkLife Law, most low wage women work several jobs at asocial hours and piece together child care. These jobs are more rigid, and more likely to have no paid sick leave. Pregnant workers are fired on the spot or immediately after their bosses find out they are pregnant, pregnant employees are banned from certain positions no matter what their qualifications are, and are often denied the small cost effective measures that would allow them to continue to work during their pregnancy. Young mothers, teen mothers, are often <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/03/06/its-not-just-those-awful-ads-in-nyc-teen-moms-are-bullied-every-day/">bullied and face additional shame, stigma, and lack of support</a>.

7.) <strong>End discrimination against people with children. </strong><em>(Caveat: people who identify as men are often given more flexibility than caregivers who identify as women, and I will be using "woman" in this section, as it is what the cited study looks at. I could not find data for trans* or gender non comforming caregivers, if you know of any, leave it in the comments!<strong>)</strong></em> The same study points out that women with caregiving duties are also held to impossible standards of attendance and scheduling, with no flexibility for justifiable time off for care giving duties.  The debate surrounding low-income women is often on how to get mothers off of welfare and into work. However, in many cases, the woman is ready and willing to work, but finds herself in work place environments that are hostile to her and ignore her need to also be a care-giver. The focus should be on making sure workplaces are willing to work with mothers and not unduly discriminate against them. These low wage jobs undercut the woman's ability to provide for both herself and her child. What woman facing an unwanted pregnancy would want to risk either her potential child's wellbeing, knowing she works for a hostile boss, or risk her job all together, which would severely hinder her ability to take care of a child? Women facing this dilemma would most likely abort.

<div style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;text-align:-webkit-auto;">

8.) <strong>End the mega-mommy myth. </strong>This is the myth that women (cis women, as in this myth trans* people do not exist) belong in the home. That after trying out that work place thing, women have /chosen/ (choice, it must be feminist!) to go back to the home, to go back to child-rearing, and that women then find the most fulfillment in child-rearing. The mommy myth was articulated in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mommy-Myth-Idealization-Motherhood-Undermined/dp/B004J8HXCW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302309577&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">"The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How it Has Undermined Women" by Susan Douglas and Meredith Michaels.</a> This myth shames women who work. This myth tells women who work and child-rear that they are hurting their children, that they are being horrible mothers, and they should never have been allowed to procreate in the first place. This is a malicious myth [read: lie] that guilts women who do have to work into feeling bad about having to work. Women who get abortions usually know they will have to work, they know they will have to juggle a child and a job. [These are usually  low-income women, they don't have 'careers' - they have a string of part time jobs, mostly because they are discriminated again for various reasons].  When the whole world is telling them that they will be bad mothers from the get-go, why would they even want to carry a pregnancy to term? Who seriously wants to be a bad mother?  An <a title="article" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/10/01/DI2009100102715.html" target="_blank">article</a> that made me bristle like a she-lion has one woman saying that we need to "empower more women" to be stay at home moms. Really? Let's couch it in feminist language, and make it look nice! This is not empowerment. This is subtly telling women that they have to stay at home, and making it look nice by saying that staying at home is "empowering." Some women have to work. Some women want to work. And you can both work and be a mom, even if some people say giving over care to another person while you are at work is going to result in "generation of spoiled, selfish, socially unconscious, ungrateful brats running around in twenty years." We need to end this myth, and make sure women who want to work, or need to work, are able to without the guilt and the shame. I don't judge you for how you want to manage your family, don't judge mine. At the same time, we need to break down the gender binary that assigns roles based on a persons gender (some of whom were coercively assigned a gender), allowing for people of all or no genders to decide how to divide labor within a community.

9.) <b> Dismantle the current foster care system. </b>One of the tactics of anti-abortion advocates is to create <a href="http://cpcwatch.org/ws_angela.php" target="_blank">Crisis Pregnancy Centers</a>, or Pregnancy Resource Centers where, in a lot of cases, they spend the first 24 weeks of a woman's pregnancy telling her how good of a mother she will be. Once she is past the point of being able to obtain a legal abortion, they change gears, telling her the only loving option is to <a href="http://feministsforchoice.com/the-crisis-pregnancy-center-adoption-racket.htm" target="_blank">put her child up for adoption</a>, other wise Child Protective Services will take her child away and put it in the foster care system. The last part, sadly, is not too far from the truth. Many women know what they can and cannot offer the children the already have, and are terrified that the often racist and classist child protective services will do. I will direct you <a href="http://protectchoice.org/article.php?id=141" target="_blank">here</a> for more on how the CPS agencies more often then not remove children from their mothers not for abuse or neglect, but for purely racist or classist ideas that poor women or women of color are not fit to be mothers. Which is bullshit. These children are then shuffled from one temporary home to another, with little to no actual love and support. If you want a woman to choose to carry to term, you better be damned sure she doesn't have this fear in the back of her mind.

Improve funding for pro-birth mother adoption programs/end adoption discrimination</strong><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;line-height:19px;">.</span><b style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;line-height:19px;"> </b><span style="line-height:19px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;">Only a handful of states have laws that make open adoption contracts enforceable. Many women who choose to carry to term and place the child for adoption would like an open adoption, but fear that the adoptive parents might try to close that relationship off. Further, many current adoption agencies (mostly run by anti-abortion groups) fail to provide appropriate information to the pregnant woman about her rights. Many states have a 24 hours waiting period between when the woman gives birth, and when the adoptive parents can take the child home. During this time the woman may change her mind. That is her right. However,these anti-abortion agencies more often then not convince the woman to sign away this waiting period. Adoption has to be pro-birth mom. She is the one carrying to term, </span><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">she is the one giving birth, and she is the one who therefore should have supports in place. One of my personal pro-choice, pro-birth mom heroes, Christina Page, founded the Adoption Access Network, a national network of pro-birth mom adoption agencies. According to Page,</span></span></div>

<blockquote><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="background-color:white;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">"We believe women who are considering adoption deserve high-quality care, accurate information in a non-coercive environment.  Because there is a lack of information, as a result of the pro-life movement having a near monopoly on adoption resources, this has been a group of women [women who are interested in adoption] who have been neglected.</span></span></blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:-webkit-auto;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="background-color:whitesmoke;font-size:13px;line-height:17px;">Adoption can be a very shadowy, sketchy field in which sometimes people with ulterior motives work under the guise of serving women but really have an interest in what a woman does with her pregnancy. But, here's the thing about the Adoption Access Network. The only interest we have is that she has all her choices available to her."</span></span></div></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:-webkit-auto;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="background-color:whitesmoke;font-size:13px;line-height:17px;">Adoption is not an alternative to abortion. To say so is to cheapen both choices. Adoption is a parenting decision. When faced with an unplanned pregnancy, a woman has two choices: to carry to term, or to not carry to term. If she chooses to carry to term, she has two choices: to raise the child herself, or to place it for adoption. If you want a woman to carry to term, then both parenting decisions (self parent, or adopt) must be available to her. Many laws on the books make adoption a highly coercive and anti-birth mom decision. If the woman decides to plan an adoption, the agency she is working with should have all options open to her for parents, including gay and lesbian parents, and potentially single parents. Many faith-based anti-abortion agencies only allow the birth mother a moderate amount of control in who will adopt her child. They pre-screen all potential adoptive parents to make sure they are the right religion, the right life style, ect. Something that a lot of CPC and anti-abortion adoption agencies do not handle well, that the agencies who are part of AAN do handle well, is post-adoption counseling for all parties involved (birth mother, adoptive parents, and the adopted child). Feelings post-adoption can range and v</span></span></div>

<blockquote>

<div dir="ltr">According to the National Advocate for Pregnant Women, we need to</div>

<div dir="ltr"><a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/02/20/new-study-shows-birth-centers-are-a-quality-option-for-low-risk-births/">Allowing women to choose whom they want to attend the birth, how they want to birth</a>, and where they want to birth can help eliminate stress and lead to a less complicated delivery. As long as a woman is getting consistent prenatal check ups, most women can safely deliver with a midwife or doula, at a birthing center. Birthing centers, doulas, and midwives can be more affordable, and<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmwh.12003/full"> just as safe as hospital delivery</a>.</div>

13.)<strong> Push back against proposed laws and repeal laws in effect that could criminalize doctors and persons who are pregnant for poor birth outcomes</strong>: As anti-choice politicians and lobbyist attempt to put into effect legislation that grants legal rights to embryos and fetuses in attempts to outlaw abortion, <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/01/14/new-study-reveals-impact-post-roe-v-wade-anti-abortion-measures-on-women/">more states are using these laws to jail, detain, and punish women with poor birth outcomes</a>. The most prominent is the <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/audio/2012/05/15/media-conference-call-implications-bei-bei-shuai-case-women-and-roe/">Bei Bei Shuai</a> case, where a woman is facing murder charges because her daughter died a few days after birth. There are many other cases where women have had medical intervention forced upon them against their direct wishes, and have faced civil commitment for refusing care. We must end this, for if a pregnant person fears jail or forced medical treatment, abortion would absolve the state of any interest in the pregnancy.

		<title>An Ode to Darrell Issa (R-CA-49)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">

Darrell Issa held DC's <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/Darrell_Issa_Proposes_DC_Budget_Power_Abortion_Funding_Ban-210279-1.html" target="_blank">budget hostage for awhile</a>, since the taxpayers of DC all pretty much agree that their tax dollars should be used for a comprehensive medicaid plan, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/15/washington-dc-abortion-ban_n_1095886.html" target="_blank">meaning it covers abortion</a>.Then he decided that even though no one really had a problem with the Occupiers, and even though they were breaking no laws, and had relatively few encounters with the police, that because they weren't Tea Partiers (who completely <i>trashed</i> the national mall during the health care debates, disobeyed several laws on the metro by eating and drinking and spilling their food everywhere..it was a disgusting few days of clean up), they had to go. Because Issa disagreed with the political point of view that Occupiers had, he decided they really didn't <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/darrell-issa-plans-hearing-on-occupy-dcs-risk-to-public-safety/2012/01/17/gIQAIMZM6P_blog.html" target="_blank">have freedom of speech</a>. Just a note: Encampment type styles, such as Occupy, have happened 3 times in DC prior to Occupy. But Occupy is bad and evil, according to Issa. Freedom of speech, to him, only applies if you are a Republican.

So, twice now Issa has attempted to impose his will on the people living in DC. He seems to think he got elected to Grey's position. Can someone please tell him this is not the case?

<!--more-->

Today, he decided that women, like disgruntled Occupiers, do not have freedom of speech. We, apparently, are not trustworthy when it comes to discussing birth control (psst! 99% of women will use contraception over her life time. 98% of Catholic women will use birth control!) Today, he blocked a woman from testifying simply because she was a dumb woman who doesn't know her place, obviously, since she is testifying  <i>in favor </i>of birth control coverage. So far the people who are speaking are conservative men. They aren't even letting men in favor testify. Fair and balanced?

I guess Issa is just following the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/media/2012/02/10/423211/cable-report-birth-control-men-women/" target="_blank">broader trend in the media</a> of ignoring <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniella-gibbs-leger/male-privilege-and-the-bi_b_1274777.html" target="_blank">women's voices</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">

There are currently 5 Republican women in Congress, and t<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/02/13/423946/republican-women-senators-breaking-ranks-with-party-come-out-in-favor-of-obama-contraception-rule/" target="_blank">wo of them have come out in support of the birth control mandate</a> as most recently modified (women still get their co-pay free birth control, and churches don't have to pay for it). Sens. Olympia Snowe (ME) and Susan Collins (ME) have <a href="http://lobby.la.psu.edu/013_Contraceptive_Coverage/organizational_statements/Planned_Parenthood/Planned_Parenthood_The_Equity_in_Prescription_Insurance_and_Contraceptive_Coverage_Act.htm" target="_blank">shown support</a> for birth control <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/02/08/421512/six-republican-senators-including-snowe-and-collins-co-sponsored-federal-contraception-mandate-in-2001/" target="_blank">in the past</a>.So, while the rest of the Republicans are trying to march themselves <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/02/has-obama-cornered-republicans-on-contraception.php?ref=fpnewsfeed" target="_blank">into non-relevance by wanting to take women back to the dark ages,</a> at least these women are taking a stand.

<!--more-->

Unlike these women, some Republicans are mistaking the pill (<a href="http://www.good.is/post/birth-control-costs-more-than-you-think-even-for-the-lucky-ones/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=bc" target="_blank">which, with copays, can sometimes cost as much as $120/month</a>) for condoms (picked up at a store for $5 for a box of 12).<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/02/10/423018/santorum-birth-control-is-not-something-you-need-insurance-for-because-it-costs-just-a-few-dollars/?mobile=nc" target="_blank"> Says Santorum</a>:
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div style="text-align:justify;">[I]nterestingly enough, here is what they are forcing them to do — <b>in an insurance policy, they or forcing them to pay for something that costs just a few dollars. Is that what insurance is for?</b> The foundational idea that we have the government tells you that you have to pay for everything as a business. <b>Things that are not really things you need insurance for, and still forcing on something that is not a critical economic need</b>, when you have an economic distress, where you would need insurance. But forcing them even more to do it for minor expenses. [emphasis added]</div></blockquote>
Back when I was still on the pill, I could get a generic for $10/month, and $30/month for name-brand. My insurance didn't discriminate in perscriptions, if a doctor wrote it, and it came in a generic brand, it was $10, if it couldn't be substituted, the name brand was $30 copay.

However, after it was determined that I could not be on a hormonal birth control, and my doctor decided it was best that I get the non-hormonal IUD, my insurance balked. I had to find a way to come up with nearly $700.

So, no, Santorum, birth control isn't just pocket change (unless you are Mitt Romney and just have cash to burn.) Birth control is a medical prescription that can add up to $700/year, and, for many women of today, that is a month of rent, an entire paycheck, and entire month of income. That isn't just something we have lying under our couch.

Not only does he think insurance coverage for birth control shouldn't be mandatory, he also expresses extremely disconcerting views on it's morality, and on its legality.

In <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2011/10/19/348007/rick-santorum-pledges-to-defund-contraception-its-not-okay-its-a-license-to-do-things/" target="_blank">recent interviews </a>he has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN7WfIZh690&amp;feature=youtube_gdata" target="_blank">vowed to do away with all federal funding for contraception</a>, saying that it devalues the act of procreation and that it allows for sex outside of marriage without the girl being punished for being a filthy whore by getting pregnant.

I would argue that birth control actually places a higher value on procreation, as it allows a couple to decide when the best time for a child is (emotionally, physically, financially, ect), and ensures that each pregnancy is a wanted pregnancy, and not an "oops" baby. Being on a form of contraception is saying "I understand that by having sex, I may get pregnant. And I am being responsible by using birth control, because I know that my resources, be they emotional, phsyical or financial, are not enough to raise a child from infancy to adulthood. I respect my limits, and would not do anything that may stretch those limits to the point of being unable to care for another human."

But Ricky here seems to think that he can impose his religious views on the rest of the nation, should he become president. Not okay. To any woman who has sex outside of marriage (which is 95% of you!) and any woman who uses a form of contraceptive (<a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html" target="_blank">99% of you!</a>) he has a few choice words:
<blockquote class="tr_bq">"One of the things I will talk about, that no president has talked about before, is I think the dangers of contraception in this country. It’s not okay. It’s a license to do things in a sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be. <b>[Sex] is supposed to be within marriage</b>. It’s supposed to be for purposes that are yes, conjugal…but also procreative. That’s the perfect way that a sexual union should happen…This is special and it needs to be seen as special.</blockquote>
Yes, your sex is evil, and wrong, and according to his book <i>It Takes a Family </i>you are reason that America is "in decline."

I do not want this guy to be in the White House.  Doing away with publically funded contraception would <i>increase</i> the number of abortions. As of right now, Guttmacher estimates that<a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contraceptive_serv.html" target="_blank"> publicly funded contraception prevents almost two million unintended pregnancies in a year.</a> Statistically speaking, forty percent of unintended pregnancies end with an abortion. So, thanks to Title X funding, almost 80,000 abortions are prevented in a year. That's a lot of abortions that aren't happening. (I wonder how many abortions sidewalk counselors prevent, probs not as many as Title X clinics.)

<img />
<span style="font-size:x-small;">Graph from Guttmacher, detailing the number of unplanned pregnancies averted with federally funded contraception, and how that hypothetical pregnancy would have ended.</span>

Further, Mr. Santorum believes that <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/01/03/396516/santorum-states-should-have-the-right-to-outlaw-birth-control/" target="_blank">states should have the right to outlaw birth control</a>. Birth control was, at one point, banned in the United States, and a few states allowed it if the couple was married. One Connecticut law was taken to the Supreme Court, known as <i>Connecticut v Griswold. </i>The court ruled that states could not ban birth control for married couples, claiming that these couples had the right to marital privacy with which the state could not interfere. This ruling was later expanded to include unmarried couples in <i>Einstadt v. Baird</i>. These cases were heard back in the 1960's, and fifty years later, Mr. Santorum doesn't think that a couple has the right to keep government out of the bedroom. Mr. Santorum, currently surging on a wave of "small government" believes that the government can tell a couple what they can and cannot do in the bedroom. Government! Now small enough to fit between sheets!

Most of the recent debacle about birth control has come up because of the Obama mandate requiring birth control without copay. The Catholic Church is now faking a "war on religion" and lobbying Congress to ban birth control all together (How dare the government tell us what to do! Now, government, force the people to follow our belief system!)

From a purely judicial view point, no such thing is happening. The Supreme Court has ruled<a href="http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2012/02/10/arguing-for-obama-justice-antonin-scalia/" target="_blank"> several times</a> that when federal law butts head with religious beliefs, the law wins. Ironically, it is Christian conservative Antonin Scalia that best argues this case. In <i>Employment Division v. Smith</i>, Scalia says:
<blockquote class="tr_bq">We have never held that an individual’s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate. On the contrary, the record of more than a century of our free exercise jurisprudence contradicts that proposition.</blockquote>
Other cases where First Amendment religious speech comes to heads with federal law is in cases of polygamy, and human sacrifice, which are explored here:
<blockquote>“… the only question which remains is whether those who make polygamy a part of their religion are excepted from the operation of the statute. If they are, then those who do not make polygamy a part of their religious belief may be found guilty and punished, while those who do, must be acquitted and go free. This would be introducing a new element into criminal law. … Suppose one believed that human sacrifices were a necessary part of religious worship; would it be seriously contended that the civil government under which he lived could not interfere to prevent a sacrifice? Or if a wife religiously believed it was her duty to burn herself upon the funeral pile of her dead husband; would it be beyond the power of the civil government to prevent her carrying her belief into practice?
… To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and, in effect, to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government could exist only in name under such circumstances.”</blockquote>
In <i>United States v. Lee</i>, a case from 1982 where Amish communities sought to not pay taxes for religious reasons, was resolved thusly:
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">“When followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes that are binding on others in that activity. Granting an exemption from social security taxes to an employer operates to impose the employer’s religious faith on the employees.”</blockquote>
</div>
I could say word for the word the exact same thing about the current birth control coverage controversy (or, as it has been called, the non-troversy.)

<a href="http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/02/13/why-i-skipped-mass-today-practicing-catholic-objects-to-bishops-arguments-over-bi" target="_blank">Catholic women use birth control</a>, and there are many, many people today who do not believe that birth control is evil, and in fact, see it as a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carol-howard-merritt/jesus-and-contraception_b_1271928.html?ref=tw" target="_blank">positive thing that is morally right.</a>  There are very few doctors out there who would deny a perscription of birth control, and many who say that medical ethics demand <a href="http://prch.org/insurance-coverage-birth-control-and-women-employed-religious-institutions" target="_blank">birth control be available freely</a>.

</div>
The funny thing about this birth control debacle, is that numerous states, and numerous federal mandates, already require most employers to cover birth control. The thing that is new about this mandate, the thing that makes this mandate different, is that now this birth control is available without a co-pay or a deductible;<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/02/10/146662285/rules-requiring-contraceptive-coverage-have-been-in-force-for-years" target="_blank"> now it is free.</a>

According to Julie Rovner of NPR:
<blockquote class="tr_bq">In fact, employers have pretty much been required to provide contraceptive coverage as part of their health plans since December 2000. That's when the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/decision-contraception.html">ruled</a> that failure to provide such coverage violates the <a href="http://www.enotes.com/pregnancy-discrimination-act-1978-reference/pregnancy-discrimination-act-1978">1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act</a>. That law is, in turn, an amendment to <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act</a>, which outlaws, among other things, discrimination based on gender.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><a href="http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/health/insurance-coverage-for-contraception-state-laws.aspx">More than half</a> the states have similar "contraceptive equity" laws on the books, many with religious exceptions similar or identical to the one included in the administration's regulation.</blockquote>
So, I really don't understand all they whining from people like Rick Santorum and the Catholic Bishops. If you don't like birth control, no one is forcing you to use it. So, please, do not force us to live by the same values you hold.

There is no war on religion going on here, Obama and the ACA are merely taking existing laws which require birth control coverage and expanding them so that coverage is free.

If birth control is more freely available and more affordable, you can bet there will be less unintended pregnancies, and therefore, less abortion. And we all know how much the Catholic Bishops and Santorum hate abortion, so please allow us to take steps to prevent the need for abortion before that need arises.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">

Whenever you are dealing with a candidate who has written extensively on how women are ruining the country, you can expect some outrageous comments. Recently, Rick Santorum, who wrote a book (<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/02/santorum-blames-wife-anti-working-woman-book-passage/48616/" target="_blank">now he is saying he didn't write it</a>) on how women being outside of the home is ruining America, is now taking aim at our servicewomen.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<div style="text-align:left;">After an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/09/military-women_n_1266038.html" target="_blank">announcement</a> that the Pentagon was going to start allowing women to serve closer to the front lines. The new rules are being sent to Congress, and if Congress does not reject them after 30 days, they will go into effect.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"><!--more--></div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Rick Santorum, thank goodness he is not in Congress, does not think that women are up to the task. He seems to think that women's emotions [later he said that he actually meant to talk about men's emotions] could get in the way of the mission.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">"I want to create every opportunity for women to be able to serve this country, and they do so in an amazing and wonderful way and they're a great addition -- and they have been for a long time -- to the armed services of our country. But I do have concerns about women in front-line combat, I think that could be a very compromising situation, where people naturally may do things that may not be in the interest of the mission, because of other types of emotions that are involved  It already happens, of course, with the camaraderie of men in combat, but I think it would be even more unique if women were in combat, and I think that's probably not in the best interest of men, women or the mission."</div></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:left;">While reading this, I totally think he was talking about women, it is pretty clear. But now he is saying he was totes talking about men having all those evil emotions:</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">"[I meant] exactly what I said. When you have men and women together in combat, I think there's -- men have emotions when you see a woman in harm's way. I think it's something that's natural, that's very much in our culture to be protective, and that was my concern."</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"> So, because I am overly paternalistic, and think women are weak and just need to stay home, for their own safety, obviously men in the military think exactly the same way and will compromise the mission to save a poor fragile woman. C'mon, the women in the military are tough as nails, and I don't think any of the men who see them are thinking "I need to save her." They are more likely thinking "I need to rape her."</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">When Santorum was asked if he was also making a commentary on women being too emotional for the military, he backtracked again:</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">"I've never raised that as a concern. No, the issue is -- and certainly one that has been talked about for a long, long time -- is how men would react to seeing women in harm's way, or potentially being injured or in a vulnerable position, and not being concerned about accomplishing the mission."</blockquote>
Women have been serving in the positions that are about to be opened up on a non-official level for some time, now, and it has not effected our current wars. In the 1970's women couldn't be stationed in a base in North Dakota because it was "too cold" (even though civilian women lived in North Dakota just fine, kthx.) Today, 15% of active duty soldiers are women, with 99% of Air Force jobs being opened to women, and  69% of Army jobs.

</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Many women, including Representative Loretta Sanchez, do not believe these adjustments go far enough, and believe that true combat equality must be achieved. Being in active combat is often necessary for advancement, promotions and bonuses. If women are left out of combat, they are often overlooked for those opportunities, making it more difficult for women to achieve higher positions.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Anu Bhagwati, executive director of the Service Women's Action Network, and former Marine Corps captain, found the rules "extremely disappointing" in that the ban on women in the infantry would continue:</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">"To continue such a ban is to ignore the talents and leadership that women bring to the military, and it further penalizes servicewomen by denying them the opportunity for future promotions and assignments that are primarily given to personnel from combat arms specialties."</div></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:left;">Fox Correspondent, Liz Trotta, decided this weekend that she <a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2012/02/fox-pundit-women-military-should-expect-get-raped-video" target="_blank">also needed to add her two cent's</a> to Santorums comments, and further criticized feminists not just for wanting women in war, but for also complaining that women in uniform get raped. A recent DOD report has found that women in the armed services are being raped and sexually assaulted, and that has increased by 64% in the last few years.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Trotta all but said that women who sign up for the military should expect to get raped. Ya see ladies, right here, it's in the job description. Just sign on the dotted line, and we can get started!</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">She also all but suggested that our uniformed men are just giant lumbering beasts who really can't control themselves, so what do we expect? Of course men are just gonna rape anything with two legs and a vagina.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Trotta is a known war-hawk, and during Vietnam, reported extensively on the ground, calling herself the first female journalist in combat. Funny, she never mentioned at the time having to fight off hordes of uniformed soldiers unable to control their manly urges.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">To wrap this all up, for the first time in his life, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell stands up for women. I know, shocking.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">“I like Rick Santorum a lot. I just disagree with any inference he might have made that somehow women are incapable of service in the front lines and serving in combat positions.”</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">McDonnell then went on to reference his daughter, a platoon leader in Iraq, “Yes, I did get emotional, but she didn’t. She got the job done.”</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
</div>

		<title>Birth Control: The New Abortion</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">

I spent Wednesday afternoons being quickly rushed from the public school I attended to the Catholic school down the street, where I would spend another two hours sitting in a desk in a class room. I learned the rosary, the Apostle's Creed, the stations of the Cross, and then my Aunt, who worked at the school full time, would take me back to my parents house (usually with a detour for a snack, much to my delight.)While my parents, being working class (like many Catholic's are), could not afford to send me and my siblings to Catholic school full time, they did shell out money to OLC for me to receive Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD, like Sunday school, but on Wednesday). I looked forward to my First Holy Communion in which I would get to wear a beautiful white dress, have my hair done, and afterward, have a party in which I was given beautiful rosaries, ornate Bibles, and a statue of the Virgin Mary.

The Catholic Church didn't seem like a monster, then. I entertained the idea of becoming a nun, as all the Sisters seemed super cool, and, besides, who wanted to get married, anyway? And the Cool Hip Young Aunt worked for OLC, so how could the Church not be cool?

<!--more-->

It wasn't until I became aware of where babies really come from that I started to have doubts. My mother and father had met and wed within a year. Everyone thought it was because mom was pregnant. She wasn't, and she wouldn't be for another six years. After the first year, according to my mother, grandma (dad's mom) began offering to pay for fertility treatments, thinking that my mom was having trouble conceiving. She wasn't. She was on The Pill.

My mother converted to Catholicism, and never had an aversion to birth control, nor did my father, despite being raised Catholic. My parents, like many other Catholics, used a form a birth control banned by the Vatican.

Being raised Catholic, I have certain biases. For instance, I really don't like a lot of Protestant faiths, since it was from Protestantism that the seeds of Capitalism were spread. While Catholicism emphasizes (at the local level, not at the Vatican) community work, and sees charity and helping the poor as noble, many Protestants emphasis that if you are poor and suffering, it is because you are not close to God, and the richer you are, the closer to God you must be (which is why management are often Protestant, and labor often Catholic). But that is another blog.

Back to my biases, I know that the Catholic Church lobbies, but I more often then not see them lobbying for the poor, and not against. I saw them lobbying *for* health care reform, as it is often the Catholic Hospitals that see the poor and under/uninsured.

I know, I know, they also lobby against abortion. But I have never seen them lobby so vehemently against birth control. I was taught the rhythm method, and I know that NFP is all the rage, and if that is your cup of tea, go for it.

But suddenly, it seems, the Catholic Church isn't just opposed to people of it's own flock using birth control, it now seems they are opposed to anyone, no matter their faith, using birth control.

For a long time, Protestants were okay with birth control. They didn't care if you were using the pill, condoms, just as long as you were doing it in wedlock, and at least managed to produce one child.

Now, birth control is the new abortion. It went from being a thing some fringe people opposed, mostly people who just hated that women weren't at home making dinner for them anymore, and is now something that the Republican nominees are all declaring their hatred for, and making campaign promises to outlaw it should they become President.

It has gone from something the priests told their congregation not to do, to something that is now being debated on cable news channels.

Is birth control wrong? Should women get a say in if they become pregnant? Should women be allowed to determine how many times they become pregnant? Should women get a say in their own lives, in how their own bodies are used?

That is the conversation now! Birth control is now just as controversial as abortion. While the Church views birth control as wrong because, according to the Vatican, it places a barrier between God, and God's will (that women be pregnant all the time), many are now saying it is the same thing as abortion, and creating all this pseudo-science around how the pill operates (stopping ovulation and thickening cervical mucous to prevent sperm from getting into the fallopian tubes) to say that the pill causes a "mini-abortion."

While I used to think that birth control was something that was common ground, I am now encountering more an more people who are anti-abortion, also being anti-contraception.

I am not having it. Birth control prevents pregnancy at a time when a woman does not want to be pregnant. Therefore, it prevents the need for abortion. If Santorum, or any other anti-birth control candidate gets elected, and bans birth control, I am keeping my IUD in. Government does not know I have it. And the nurse that inserted it is bound by HIPAA. They will have to shackle me and forcibly remove it if they want me to no longer have it.

		<title>Maternal Mortality, Doulas, and Midwives</title>
		<link>http://www.nikkilizmurray.com/maternal-mortality-doulas-and-midwives/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">

Recently a study was published that found <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/23/us-abortion-idUSTRE80M2BS20120123" target="_blank">abortion to be safer than childbirth</a>. Many on the choice side of the abortion debate are hailing this as a victory, pointing the fingers back at the prolife side of the debate, saying "We told you it was safer, can you please stop lying to women saying abortion is dangerous?"The problem is that no one should be celebrating this finding. The dark side of this study is that it finds childbirth to be less safe than a routine medical procedure done here in the United States.<a href="http://www.womendeliver.org/about/the-issue/" target="_blank"> One in 2,100 women</a> will die in the United States from childbirth or pregnancy. That is a horrible statistic. Especially since the comparable abortion number is 1 in 1,000,000 deaths for abortions performed before 8 weeks (when most are performed),  to 1 in 11,000 for abortions performed after 21 weeks (which is usually only done in cases of fetal or maternal indications).<!--more-->

In many European nations, the maternal mortality rate is 1 in 11,000ish depending on the country. There are many factors involved in why childbirth is safer in the Eurozone, than here in the US. For instance, lack of contraceptive access results in more unplanned pregnancies, which, in the US,<a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/main/statistics.html" target="_blank"> half of all pregnancies are unplanned</a>, with 70% of women of childbearing age being sexually active, but on 64% of those women using a reliable form of contraception. Statistically speaking, a woman with a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743597902176" target="_blank">wanted pregnancy is more likely to seek maternal and prenatal care earlier on in the pregnancy</a> than the woman facing an unplanned pregnancy, if the latter seeks care at all (12% of women with planned pregnancies skipped prenatal care, while 22% of women with unplanned pregnancies failed to seek prenatal care). In Europe, comparably, I am finding the unintended pregnancy rate to be between 30 - 40 percent. Further, in Europe, paid maternity leave is a right, not a privilege. In some cases, paid maternity leave can be up to as long as a year, and with at least 80% pay during this time. If you haven't seen this already, I suggest you check out FOX correspondent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BfSBxk0FMc" target="_blank">Megyn Kelly </a>on why maternity leave is important (note: this is probably one of the very few things in which I agree with Megyn Kelly). Additionally, as health care is universal and free in most of these countries, women who are poor have access to quality prenatal and maternal care, in which complications can be identified early, and treated and prepared for early.

Today, many births in the United States happen in hospitals, and are actually the biggest money makers for those hospitals, with unnecessary c-sections accounting for a lot of that money. C-sections are often done for the doctors convenience, not for the patients safety or health. A doctor often doesn't want to be sitting around for 19 hours while a woman naturally dilates and goes into labor. 1 in 3 women deliver by c-section in the United States, and a woman is more likely to die from a c-section than from a vaginal birth. C-sections also create risks for placenta previa and placenta accreta in future pregnancies that could also cause death.

I have recently gotten involved in the birth activist community, and am thrilled to be part of the revolution. Birth is a natural thing that is medicalized past the point of recognition. Women's bodies know what to do. We were giving birth outside of hospitals for ages. The midwives and doulas of today are trying to make sure that birth is a holistic and safe procedure. A lot of complications in the United States are from introducing too much unnecessary medicine or technology into the birthing process.

We could reduce the risk of maternal mortality by following the doula and midwife standards of care into childbirth, making sure that women who are pregnant and choose to carry to term have access to prenatal care, support systems, and information on safe birthing and pregnancy practices, by reducing the number of unintended pregnancies by increasing access to affordable contraceptives and birth control, while also increasing sexual health education, and, of course, making these things affordable. A woman's birthing experience should never depend on the size of her wallet.

		<title>Criticism, Fascism, And Obama 2012</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It appears that anytime I criticize Obama, I find myself immediately attacked by a horde of liberals who accuse me of fascism, say that by speaking even a syllable of ill about the President is tantamount to being a Republican, and that I must not really care about women's rights or gay rights. (Hint: I am a gay woman who works at a prochoice organization and is an abortion doula on the side, who has also volunteered for numerous pro-LGBT organization. I think I kinda care).

Any time I mention any of the horrible betrayals of Obama, I am told I am only helping the other side. Or, that those things are really Obama's fault.

There is this huge taboo in the social justice bloggosphere about mentioning any of the horrible things that Obama has done. Why are we unable to criticize him? Why is he untouchable?

<!--more-->

He swept into office on a platform of repealing the massive curtailment of civil liberties that happened under Bush, ending the massively expensive and totally unnecessary wars, and putting America back on her feet.

What do we get? An extension of all the unConstitutional (I don't throw that word around lightly, FYI) provision of the Patriot Act, now coupled with the equally unConstitutional NDAA, and a meek and mild hummhawwing about how SOPA might, maybe, could be okay, if, maybe, and Gitmo?....

Now the same people who sat around complaining and crying about the invasiveness of the PATRIOT Act are suddenly OK with it because Obama extended it, they are OK with NDAA because Obama signed it, and now they are OK with handing the government expansive powers to spy, torture, and detain citizens without charge or trial because they know Obama is a good guy who would never actually do it. Seriously? It's OK if it's Obama doing it?

I am not sitting down and taking that. I am criticizing the President of the United States. That doesn't make me a Republican. It makes me a person who disapproves of his actions as President.

<i>But if you criticize him, you are making it easier for the Republicans to get elected!</i> Really? How's that? Am I going out and voting for Newt, Santorum, Romney, or Paul? No. Am I telling people not to vote for Obama because of this? No, I am saying that Obama needs to shape up. He is digging his own grave. My criticizing him, and others criticizing him, will hopefully help him and his administration see that we are not blind sheep who will follow him no matter what. He is still responsible to us.

<i>But criticizing Obama is that same thing as supporting the Republicans, and they hate gays!</i> Well, Obama really hasn't done anything for the LGBT community, except, you know, geting rid of DOMA like he promised...Oh wait. He had his legal department defend DOMA.

<i>The Republicans will make abortion illegal, though!</i> And Obama signed an executive order banning the coverage of abortion on state health insurance exchanges and massively curtailed the ability of private insurance companies to offer abortion coverage, effectively making abortion legal but out of reach for thousands. And his administration doesn't think women are smart enough to read the labels of Plan B, and therefore decided to deny it over the counter status. So, I really don't think Obama is any better.

<i>Well, if you don't like Obama, you're a fascist! No room in the Democratic tent for you, anymore! So either get out, or get back in line!</i> OOOOh, so I'm the fascist one, because I am not lock-foot with the Democratic party. I am the fascist one for criticizing Obama on signing a very fascist piece of legislation (NDAA) and extending another piece of fascist legislation (PATRIOT Act). Frankly, this "get in line, NOW" attitude from many in the Democratic Party is very fascist, and, more to the point, appalling.

<i>Well, if not Obama, than who? Let me guess, you were a Hilary Supporter? Hah. </i> Not the point.  Maybe we could eschew the 2 party system all together and actually make a progressive party that has a backbone and doesn't just give in to the Republicans every time they cough.  Seriously, is Mitt Romney's health care plan (the same health care reform that Republicans were so fond of in the 1990s with it's individual mandate and free market capitalist solutions....) the best the Democrats could do?

<i>Just go vote for Ron Paul, already, if you hate Obama that much.  </i>Thanks for bringing him up. Yeah, he is an Ayn Rand superhero on steriods and would turn the country into some sort of Thunderdome of capitalism where people of color, women, and LGBT folks would weep on the sidelines of society out of sight from the capitalist captains of industry. But he is the <b>only anti-war candidate.</b> He is the only candidate that talks seriously about ending the American Empire (which is costly in both lives and money). He isn't taken seriously as a candidate because of these views. Why is being anti-war and anti-imperialist a bad thing?

<i>Oh! So you DO like Ron Paul! What do you have against people of color, gays, and women anyway?  </i>Ugh. I don't, thank you, Mr. I-Canvass-For-Obama. I have something against fascism. I have something against war. And, funny thing, you said the same thing 4 years ago. 4 years ago you said that Obama thought the same thing. Guess you are more devoted to a candidate than to principals or ideals.

For the record, I do not support Ron Paul due to his love of capitalism, his hatred of people of color, his desire to put government between me and my doctor, and his views on LGBT folks. I do, however, think that we need to discuss the role of our military in the world, how much we are spending on that military, and whether that military needs to be used to the extent that it currently is. I also think we do need to end the drug war. It is costly, ineffective, and it is not curtailing drug use.

I work with women seeking abortions on a daily basis and help them pay for those abortions. I am queer. I used to serve on the board of my college's Pride organization. So, as you can see, I do not have anything against gays or women, thank you very much. I criticized Obama. That is all. Go back to trolling twitter.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On Feminists and Men</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="147"]<a href="http://mrg.bz/Tqo4Vc"><img src="http://mrg.bz/Tqo4Vc" alt="" width="147" height="173" /></a> Anti-feminists would like the genders to be at war. Feminists don't want gender divides (via <a href="http://mrg.bz/2fraCb">morguefile</a>.)[/caption]

There is a lot of confusion about the relationship between feminism, and men. Some mistakenly assert that since feminism is about advancing women's rights, it must therefore also be about taking away men's rights. These people would have you believe that the gender wars are a zero sum game. In order for women to gain rights, men must be deprived of rights. There isn't a limited supply of rights. Rights are inherent, and belong to everyone. Women, in attempting to gain rights, are acquiring the same rights that men have had all along, so that men and women have the same rights. Feminists aren't attempting to take rights away from men.

<!--more-->

Women seek to have bodily autonomy, just as men do. This, to some, may seem like the "right" for a man to own a woman's body is being taken away, but there is no inherent right to own someone. It wasn't a right. So it isn't something that is being deprived of them. An analogy is the fight in parts of the queer movement to gain legal marriage recognition. Some religious sects assert this is taking away their rights to religious liberty. They define that liberty as the right to discriminate against gay and lesbian couples. Again, there is no inherent right to discriminate, so this isn't a right that is being taken away.

<em>What might feel like a loss of rights to some men, is actually an erosion of privilege.</em>

Feminists don't hate men, feminists don't want there to be distinctions between the sexes that grant preferential treatment to one or the other. In my feminism, I would prefer there is <em>no gender</em> or a <em>gender spectrum </em> comprising of more than just two genders. To be stuck in a gender box assigned at birth, with only one other option is entirely limiting, and leads to situations like patriarchy, where one gender is preferred over the other. Many gender traditionalists will say that women and men are separate, but equal. We have different jobs, and skills, and neither is preferred, but both must work in harmony. I call bullshit. The labor that is assigned to women, that is home making and child rearing, are important, but the system we live in only pays lip service to their importance, and clearly places more esteem onto the labor of men (as it's paid). Women are to be quiet and demur, and men are to be confident and loud. The double standards are endless.

However, feminism realizes that no persons full expression can be confined into the demarcated genders. Patriarchy says men do not cry, and women are not emotionally equipped to deal with politics and war. Feminism says <em>men absolutely can and should cry if they need to cry. </em>Feminism says fathers should not be shamed for wanting to be stay-at-home dads, feminism says fathers can be caring, involved and nurturing fathers without being shamed or seen as creepy. Feminism says men are responsible human beings capable of respecting their fellow human beings and treating them accordingly.

Patriarchy says men are irresponsible animal who cannot control themselves, and must therefore be allowed to rape without impunity. Patriarchy says men cannot be held responsible for their own actions, and therefore women must be responsible for them.

Feminists think very highly of men. Patriarchy doesn't.]]></content:encoded>

<strong><a name="biology"></a>Biology</strong>

A healthy person with a uterus generally has a 28 day fertility cycle. Day one of the cycle is generally counted as the first day that person menstruates, or releases tissue and blood that had collected on the uterine wall. The length of the menstrual period has little to no bearing on the actual fluctuation of hormones and the length of the cycle. Generally, 14 days later one of the ovaries will release an egg, even if your period lasts 10 days, or two. The egg hangs out for about a day, before "dying" and collecting with other blood and tissue in the uterus, and then eventually being released with the period another 14 days later. If there are any sperm hanging out in the fallopian tubes, it may fertilize the egg, and create a zygote. If this happens, the zygote will then take about 5 days to make its way to the uterine, where, if conditions are right, it has about a 60% chance of implanting, and a pregnancy will start. Generally speaking, sperm may take a few days to make there way to the fallopian tubes, and can generally hang out there for about 5 days. So, your period can start on June 1st. You have sex on June 9th. The sperm make their way to your fallopian tubes, and hang out, where on June 14th, you ovulate. If we're using averages, on June 19th it will implant and you are pregnant.

But people have different cycle lengths, and even the most regular of people may have rogue cycles because they are stressed, or haven't been eating or eating too much or aren't sleeping, or any host of reasons can cause a person to not have a regular cycle, with regularity. It is also impossible to tell <em>when exactly</em> a pregnancy started with any certainty. What do we know with certainty? The first day of a persons last menstrual period. So when trying to determine how far into a pregnancy a person might be, many health professionals use the first day of the last normal period. So if our above described person missed a period on June 28th, and it is now July 5th, a week later, she would be at 5 weeks gestation, even though the pregnancy might have started on June 19th.

<a name="history"></a><strong>History</strong>

In colonial America, abortion was widespread and easily accessible. It was advertised in news papers as "unblocking menses" and could be performed by a midwife, apothecary, or physician. According to the <a href="http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/history_abortion.html">National Abortion Federation;</a>
<blockquote>Abortion has been performed for thousands of years, and in every society that has been studied. It was legal in the United States from the time the earliest settlers arrived. At the time the Constitution was adopted, abortions before "quickening" were openly advertised and commonly performed.</blockquote>
Quickening is when a person who is pregnant first feels movement in the uterus, usually around 20 to 24 weeks gestation (that is since last normal menstrual period). The reason it was not performed after that was for safety purposes, not due to a concern for fetal life or a bestowing of rights upon a fetus.

<blockquote><span style="font-size:x-large;">U</span>NTIL the last third of the nineteenth century, when it was criminalized state by state across the land, abortion was legal before "quickening" (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy). Colonial home medical guides gave recipes for "bringing on the menses" with herbs that could be grown in one's garden or easily found in the woods. By the mid eighteenth century commercial preparations were so widely available that they had inspired their own euphemism ("taking the trade").</blockquote>
Like most surgical and medical procedures done before anti-biotics, sterilization, and a comprehensive knowledge of the human body, it could be risky. Also, just as today there are fake viagra pills available on the internet, the then-contemporary version of the internet - news paper advertisements, often advertised fake remedies and pills that were often fatal. As the National Abortion Federation puts it;
<blockquote>During the 1800s, all surgical procedures, including abortion, were extremely risky. Hospitals were not common, antiseptics were unknown, and even the most respected doctors had only primitive medical educations. Without today's current technology, maternal and infant mortality rates during childbirth were extraordinarily high. The dangers from abortion were similar to the dangers from other surgeries that were not outlawed.</blockquote>
The first regulations of abortion in the 1820's and 1830's were not to restrict access to abortion, but were rather poison control laws, and the sale of abortion drugs were banned, but not the procedure itself.

This did not stop abortions; the most famous practition of abortion, Madam Restell, operated practices in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, as well as having a travelling sales show where she advertised "Female Monthly Pills."

The actual criminalization of the abortion procedure came about by the American Medical Association; again, not for any concern of fetal life. Rather, it was a power grab. The (all-male, all white) AMA wanted to solidify their spot as the premiere health care providers, demonizing and stigmatizing fields dominated by people of color and women, such as midwifery.

The anti-abortion crusade of the AMA found allies in nativist moves, anti-Catholic groups, and social conservatives. Nativists saw a threat in the immigrants who came to the country and had more children then the Protestant women (the largest segment procuring abortion services at the time). Many of these immigrants were from Catholic countries (Ireland, Italy, Poland, for example) and saw their large families as a threats. The anti-abortion groups wanted to coerce and force more Protestant women into reproducing, and this sentiment is exemplified by Horatio R Stoerer, an anti-abortion physician, who said "This is the question our (sic: white Protestant) women must answer; upon their loins depends the future destiny of the nation."

Regardless, many doctors continued providing abortions for their patients. Rough estimates place the number around 2 million abortions a year, which is much higher than todays abortion rate. Unless a woman at the time died from the procedure, many doctors were never arrested. Those who did not perform the procedure candidly gave referrals to those who did, and in one undercover expose, the Chicago Medical Society head gave out a referral to a journalist. Midwives, the group the AMA hoped to demonize out of business, continued to provide them largely unnoticed and unhindered.

Abortion was banned to give physicians legitimacy, to give politicians political gains and victories with certain nativist populations, and, finally, it gave a coercive message from social conservatives to women: stay in your place. It was used to humilate women who were found out, to send a message that if you had an abortion, you were punished for eschewing your gender roles. Women who had abortion complications, or even miscarriage complications, were denied life-saving medical treatment until they "confessed" to having an abortion. They were coerced to make "dying declarations" implicating the doctor, the male involved in the pregnancy. As Pollit puts it:
<blockquote>because the words of the dying are legally admissible in court, women on their deathbeds were informed by police or doctors of their imminent demise and harassed until they admitted to their abortions and named the people connected with them -- including, if the woman was unwed, the man responsible for the pregnancy, who could be arrested and even sent to prison.</blockquote>
This is how abortion operated for decades; Pollit continues
<blockquote>This state of affairs -- widespread availability punctuated by law-enforcement crackdowns, popular-press scandals, and fitful attempts at medical self-policing -- persisted for decades. Unsurprisingly, the Depression, during which women stood to lose their jobs if they married or had a child, saw a big surge in the abortion rate</blockquote>
It was around the 1940's that the horror stories of "pre-Roe" started to surface. Suddenly law and medicine combined forces to drive the businesses further underground or out of business. Networks that had been built up, referrals, clinics, were disrupted. This is when "abortion wards" or "septic tanks" became common place, those images of women dying of sepsis in the hospital after fatal, illegal, and clandestine abortions done by an inexperience doctor or knitting needs. Of course, wealthy women could convince a reputable doctor to allow her a "therapeautic abortion" legally, travel to a doctor who would, and find someway to obtain one safely, if not legally. It was often the poor women, early on, who died. But by the 1950's, doctors who could safely perform the procedure stopped for fear of prosecution, and even in life threatening conditions, doctors were fearful of being prosecuted for performing an abortion when a woman wasn't dying enough. Some hospitals set up "therapeutic abortion committees" to rule on abortion requests, to ensure no single person took the fall if they saved a woman's life. At some hospitals, suicide attempts were reason enough, at others, not so.

Before Roe v Wade, the criminality of abortion was not about protecting fetal life at all. Openly, it was about creating a medical establishment elite, ensuring white Protestant supremacy, and keeping women firmly in their place.

The goals of the anti-choice, anti-abortion movement today are largely the same: keeping women in their place, and ensuring that white women aren't aborting. Today, however, they couch it in a concern for fetal life, and attempt to ban it by granting the fetus the same rights and privileges afforded to born person.

<a name="personhood"></a><strong>Personhood today</strong>

Today the war-cry of the anti-abortion movement is the idea of giving fetuses, from the moment of fertilization, the same rights as any other person though a "personhood" amendment. To them, giving a fetus the rights of a person would make abortion de facto illegal, as it would be the same as murder. They make no exceptions for the life of the person who is pregnant, or rape and incest survivors.

However, since the fetus occupies the pregnant persons body, the pregnant person would <em>have </em> to lose his or her rights. As any "slip up" in being the perfect pregnant person could result in a miscarriage, and as any miscarriage could now be seen as manslaughter at best, a pregnant person could be prosecuted for miscarrying, having a still birth, or giving birth to a child with defects. People could be jailed for having a less than optimal pregnancy outcome. <a title="mississippi" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/24/america-pregnant-women-murder-charges">It</a> <a title="paltrow" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lynn-m-paltrow/how-personhoodusa-and-the_b_176530.html">is</a> <a title="more paltrow" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lynn-m-paltrow/personhoodusa-promoting-a_b_773572.html">already</a> <a href="http://www.advocatesforpregnantwomen.org/issues/punishment_of_pregnant_women/">happening</a>.  But personhood would make these cases not strange news stories, but common occurrences.

People who are pregnant could be jailed for being overly stressed, taking a wrong medication mistakenly, unknowingly sipping the wrong glass at New Years Eve. People who are pregnant could be denied cancer treatment that might interfere with the pregnancy, or being denied any other medicine that may have even a slight risk for a defect. A pharmacist could refuse to fill a prescription for any person they think may be pregnant, even if they aren't. A cashier could refuse to sell coffee to a person they suspect may be pregnant, even if that coffee is for someone else. Cis-women, and those who pass as cis-women, could be pulled over for potentially driving while pregnant. Anyone who could potentially be pregnant would be treated as "pre-pregnant" as, like the biology lesson explained above, <em>you could already be considered pregnant, even if you don't know it yet. </em>So you would have to operate as if every person who could potentially <em>be </em>pregnant, <em>is </em>pregnant.

When I bring up this fact to anti-abortion activists, they say "Well that didn't happen before Roe." No, it didn't. Because abortion was banned as a procedure, not categorized as murder. Even before Roe, the fetus has no rights. But the anti-abortion movement wants to give rights to fetuses, which have never had rights before.

Remember the earlier example? How a person could be 5 weeks into a pregnancy? Say that same person has some abnormal periods. So she might have gotten pregnant on June 19th, and then she starts bleeding on July 5th, a week after she was supposed to. This person might not think anything of it. It wasn't a pregnancy, this person never got a pregnancy test, for whatever reason, and now, to them, it is just a late period. (People put off getting pregnancy testing because 1.) It can be embarrassing, as they are often kept locked up with the condoms, requiring a pharmacist, 2.) They can be expensive (yes, many places offer them for free, but it's, again, embarrassing, it's something most people want to do in private) and 3.) It could be just a late period, so why not wait one more week to see if your period comes? I also do the latter. Wait one more week, if it doesn't come, <em>then </em>take it).

But, if personhood becomes a thing, then will we have to get every late period tested? For that matter, a <em>normally timed</em> period might <em>still </em>be a very early miscarriage. Would we be forced to submit every pad and tampon as "potential miscarriage evidence."

This is happening <em>now. </em> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/20/mark-obenshain-miscarriage-bill_n_3307578.html">The man running on the Republican ticket for Attorney General in Virginia wants to jail women for not reporting a miscarriage to the police within twenty four hours of it happening.</a> Apparently, the miscarried products of conception are supposed to be "evidence." But it's not clear what they are supposed to be evidence of. Any of the above described incidents, perhaps?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Earning Your Abortion: Why Life Endangerment Exceptions Are Not Enough</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--more-->
A little while back, I tweeted that if I became pregnant, I would need an abortion to save my life.

I received not a small number of people flat out telling me I deserved to die, and a larger number of people demanding my medical records so they could judge for themselves if am abortion was really necessary. None of these people were doctors, yet they all demanded a say in my medical treatment.

Still others wanted to know my sexual history; some deemed me too slutty, and even though I am now in a monogamous marriage, my past sexual history made my right to life null and void. 

Further yet, there were some who tried to teach me about birth control. I spend my days teaching people about sexual and reproductive health, and found this amusing. After I explained that me and my spouse use multiple methods, I thought I had at least "earned my abortion" from these folks. But no, they moved the goal post and said I should get sterilized. When I explained that it is a long, expensive process, this became to them, "just an excuse to kill your baby" and I clearly wasn't trying hard enough to prevent a life threatening pregnancy, therefore I deserved to die.

This is why banning abortion in all cases except for the life of the person who is pregnant will never work. There will always be someone who doesn't think your life is in danger enough. Or someone who might believe you will die, but sees your death as appropriate punishment.

Insert tweets as appropriate]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">I briefly reviewed all of the Lunar Chroniciles books thus far in my post about unintentionally not reading men in 2014. Thus far I've made it to March with out reading a fiction book by a man. As a woman just getting into the tech scene, I've been very tempted to break my self-set challenge when it comes to reading books for my career.

However, I do have bills to pay, and unfortunately my apartment does not understand why I should put money toward books first, and rent second.

I own my own domain, and pay for hosting. I must pay for the books I read, as I want to support these authors and sometimes the local libraries are dreadfully slow in purchasing books by marginalized authors. I am setting up a Patreon to help support these costs in reviewing books. My reviews will still be freely available here. They will first be available on Patreon, though. You can contribute as little as $1 per review. I am hoping to do more frequent reviews, but most likely never more than 5 a month.

If you are interested in supporting me in reviewing books, please head over to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NikkiMurray">Patreon</a>. My coding and feminism posts are not part of this effort, and will be available here still, for free.  I am working on my own app to recommend books featuring diverse main characters. If you want to support that, please either donate via paypal (on my about page) or check out my code on my github and get in touch about contributing.

You may have noticed I set up an amazon store, too. Please feel free to browse through and purchase books from the review's I've posted, and other books by those authors.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I went to a small liberal arts college with a unique approach to ensuring a well-rounded education. At Allegheny, there are three over-arching departments: Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences. Humanities includes history, English, Spanish, French, German, music, art, and other similar disciplines. Social Sciences were Psychology, Political Science, Economics, and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality studies and other related fields. Natural Sciences were Biology, Math, Physics, and other related fields. In order to graduate, you had to have a major in one department, a minor in another, and take at least 8 credits in the remaining department. I ended up with a major in Political Science, a minor in the Creative Writing: Poetry track, and I took astronomy and environmental science as my natural science courses. My electives were mostly philosophy and music courses. No, I had no intention of ever having a career that would allow me to pay off my student debt, why do you ask? Writing villanelles about mutually assured destruction is a PASSION. 

With that in mind, I get asked a lot about how those skills do or do not translate to writing code. When it comes to political science? I've got nothing, sorry. I'll think on it and get back to you, but, for now, I like to believe that studying poetry directly maps to having a solid toolset for responsible code design and planning.

When you decide to write a poem, you must decide at the start what the structure will be. You cannot pick at random. You cannot decide that you are writing a love poem, and think "tercets will work." You see, tercets are always going to be associated with Dante, and therefore, with descent into hell. You might pick tercets if this is a love gone horribly wrong poem. But if this is your standard "head over heels" love poem, and you pick tercets just because, people are going to think you don't know your medium very well. And you don't. You need to know what the rules are before you can meaningfully break them. 

When you decide to make a site, you must decide what the structure will be. You cannot pick at random. You cannot decide to make a static site and think "a rails application will work." Rails apps are always going to need databases and written for CRUD. You might choose a rails app if you want to try to make a blog, but if this is a standard static site with static content and you pick Rails just because, people will think you don't know your medium very well. And you don't, you need to know what the rules are before you can meaningfully break them. 

The thing with poetry is that every word must play it's role to the fullest. Every enjambment must have a purpose. There are many rules in poetry, and many traditions. Not being aware of them can lead to a poem that misses its mark. For many poem structures, there are a set number of lines and syllables. You have to be concise, you have to pick words that fullfill the meaning of the poem, and also fit the structure, the meter.

		<title>My reproductive choices are not referendum on yours</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For a long time, in the United States, childbearing among white women and the rearing of them were compulsory, not mandated by law per se, but societal forces found ways to demonize, stigmatize, and criminalize those white women who did not contribute to the white race by producing enough children out outstrip the people of color. Meanwhile, women of color were forcibly sterilized, or had the children they did have removed from their care.

Due to numerous inequalities in wealth, privilege, and access, throughout history different groups of women had to make, coerced or by force, reproductive choices they did not want to make, or had the ability to choose taken away from them.

This trend continues today, where women of means can have access to the full spectrum of choices, ranging from a reliable form a birth control, to abortion, and into access to assisted reproductive technologies and pricey private adoptions. Women without means must scrimp and save to afford an abortion, often choose abortion out of necessity rather than it being a true choice, and low-income women who <em>want </em>children will never be able to afford ART or adoption. And the fear-mongering conservatives continue to hand-wring over whether white women are having enough babies, and fret that black women are having too many.

The point is, no one makes their reproductive choices in vacuums. Many people think long and hard when deciding how, and when, to reproduce. Many people try very hard to prevent a pregnancy that would not be welcome, and many people try very hard to plan a much wanted pregnancy. These are private choices that are made behind closed doors, often made with consultation of loved ones, doctors, and clergy. They are personal, and they are private.

<!--more-->

But they come loaded with history, they come loaded with context. They will either reinforce a stereotype, or defy it. In the end, a person making a decision about becoming a parent or delaying parenthood, or forgoing parenthood altogether, will upset someone.

This is why the decision to be intentionally childfree by choice is so fraught. It gets at the very heart of gender norms, class, race, and wealth. For a white, married, middle class woman, she is eschewing her white duty to perpetuate the race, and she cannot claim resource scarcity as a reason for forgoing children, and she is taking a stab at the idea of what it means to be a white middle class woman.

For a person of color, being childfree can be construed as giving into the system white people set up to exterminate people of color through structural violence. Further, black women, according to stereotypes, are supposed to be super sexual, and very promiscuous, and therefore, have tons of children, all to different fathers. They are lazy, and use their uterus to get checks. Black women who are childfree, are sometimes, therefore, tokenized as the "<em>good </em>black person" by the white establishment, they are held out as models to those <em>other, bad </em>black people.

And of course, it is not just society one has to deal with when making private, personal decisions about when, how, and if to reproduce. There are your parents, your family, and your friends, all of whom think they are entitled to give you their opinion whether or not you ask for it.

The people I've encountered who have "tut-tutted" my <em>choice </em> to remain childfree have largely fallen into two distinct camps. Those who think I've left my place as a woman, and those who take my childfree-ness as a personal attack on their reproductive choices.

The former, I have no time for. These people will never learn, largely because they <em>don't want to learn,</em> that their worldview cannot be forced carte blanc on the masses. They would love to legislate us back to the 1950's when white men were people, and everyone else was property in all but name. They want to see women return to the home, to make babies and cook dinner, they want to see the hand full of token people of color in high powered positions forced back into the low-wage manual labor, they want to see gender and sexual minorities executed under sodomy laws or back in the closet. There is no arguing with them. So, for the most part, I try not to argue with them.

The latter, on the other hand, are largely my friends and family. (Not that members of my family don't belong to the former, too.) When I say "I don't want kids" they hear "Having kids is awful and I don't know why anyone does it, your kids are awful, and I hate them." They take my personal, private decision, that really only affects me, personally. They feel that I am holding a referendum on their reproductive choices, when, I am merely declaring my own choices. They get defensive, and so, they start "firing back" at me with probing questions, seeking to inflict the same harm to me that they think I intentionally caused to them. They couch these barbs in faux-concern over my decision making capabilities. They tell me I will "regret it later" or that I won't ever know "real love." Sometimes they are more pointed in telling me that I am being "selfish" or "self-centered" and that I am somehow denying my "womanhood" and that I will never be a "real woman."

My decision not to have children is not a referendum on your decision to have children. I believe that procreating is morally neutral. The act of giving birth has no moral weight to it. The only people that can attach morality to it are the people involved in that specific birth. Some people would identify black women who have "Too Many Children" (they are always vague about what that exact number is...) are procreating in a morally wrong way, while they might identify Michelle Duggar's reproductive choices as morally good. To me, they are individual choices individuals made based on their circumstances, and cannot and should not be judged. They are the only ones who can decide if their individual pregnancies and births were "good" or "bad" or if they even want to attach a value and morality to their pregnancies. My evaluation of my situation, personal history, medical history, emotional and physical resource ability, which lead me to make a reproductive decision does not lead me to pass judgement on your choices.

I trust that people are capable decision makers. I trust that the people I surround myself with, my friends and family, make informed decisions. I trust that people I don't know, strangers, people I will never meet, are capable of making informed decisions about their own bodies and their own reproduction. Part of that decision making involves deciding who to and not to ask for an opinion. If I was not consulted, I accept it. I still trust that they made the best decision possible for them. I do not get to have an opinion. I am not entitled to pass judgement. If a friend or relative decides to have a second child, I don't tut tut about their ability to raise it. I offer support. I ask them "would you like help? How can I support you?" If a friend or family member of mine is having their tenth child, I treat them the same way. If a friend or family member discloses to me that they don't want kids, I still support them, offering referrals to doctors specializing in long acting contraception.

I don't ask my friend with ten children if she can really afford another, and I don't ask my friend who wants no children if she is really sure about her decision. I trust that both of them have made informed decisions based on the context of their lived experiences and their inherited histories based on their situation.

Because I don't take their reproductive choices as referendums on my reproductive choices. Therefore, people who would pass judgement on others choices, know that they are not calling into question <em> your </em> choice, merely voicing theirs. My decision not to have children is not an attack on your decision to have a child, to have two children, or to have ten. If you are a person with three children, and you found out a friend was stopping after having two kids, would you sit there going "Why aren't you having three? Three is really a good number. You'll regret not having another. You'll change your mind, but by then it might be too late"?

No. You wouldn't. Or, at least, you really shouldn't. Just because not everyone has three kids doesn't mean there is something wrong with you for having three kids. Just because not everyone has three kids doesn't mean everyone is judging you for having three kids. There decision to stop after two children is not a referendum or your private and personal decision to have three. Same applies to people who choose not to have children at all. They aren't judging you for having three kids.

So stop judging those who choose not to have kids. Seriously. We don't care how many kids you have. At all. Not even a little.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What Not To Say To Someone You Think Is In A Domestic Violence Situation</title>
		<link>http://www.nikkilizmurray.com/what-not-to-say-domestic-violence/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Written in collaboration with Heather Parker of<a href="http://www.antigoneawakens.com/"> Antigone Awakens</a></em>

Dear friends, family, acquaintances, and random strangers:

As survivors of domestic violence, we’ve been through a lot of hurt. Sadly, sometimes those hurtful things have come to us, albeit unwittingly, by your own hands. We know you mean well, and we know you want to see us safe, but you only see a glimpse of what we might be going through. If you REALLY want to help us, please take the following to heart:

1.) <strong>Don't tell us we should leave</strong>. We know we should. Often we do not feel it is safe to do so. Actually, don’t tell us what to do at all. Instead tell us you are there for us if we need you, in whatever way we need you. You can tell us you support whatever decision we make, and can offer a couch or a shoulder.

<!--more-->

2.) <strong>Don't tell us you don't like our partners</strong>. We see ourselves as an extension of our partner, and therefore we interpret this attack on our partner and our relationship as an attack on us. We often cannot mentally separate ourselves as a separate being from the relationship. So, attacking the partner is the same as attacking who we are.

3.) <strong>Don't tell us you don't like the way he treats us</strong>. We interpret this as an attack on our ability to be treated well. We start thinking about what we did to deserve ill treatment. Or, that we somehow are the reason we aren’t being treated well. We don’t want others to think less of us, and try very hard to hide the abuse from friends and family until we are confident to tell them. Mentioning you don’t like this tells us you have figured it out, and we might be told by our partners to see less of you. If you are going to mention this, don’t make it about him, make it about us. Perhaps try “I’ve noticed you have seemed upset lately. Do you want to talk?”

4.) <strong>Don’t tell us you know we’re being abused</strong>. You don’t know that, and you don’t get to decide that. We get to decide how we interpret how we’re being treated. Besides, we know we’re being abused, we don’t need you to tell us that.

5.) <strong>Don’t ask us what we did to provoke the abuse</strong>. We didn’t do anything to provoke it. We exist. That is provocation enough. Asking us what we did blames us for our abuser’s actions.

6.) <strong>Don’t threaten to end our friendship if we don’t leave our abuser or go back to the relationship</strong>. Again, leaving isn’t always safe for us, and the average survivor leaves seven times before they leave an abusive relationship for good. We need you as our lifeline while we figure a safe way out of this abusive situation. Withholding friendship or communications is a tactic an abuser uses to control the person they are abusing; we don’t appreciate our friends using the same tactic on us.

7.) <strong>Don’t tell us we’re overreacting or trivialize our experience</strong>. If we’ve overcome the shame and embarrassment of the fact that we’re in an abusive relationship enough to share it with you, it means we trust you to believe us. If you belittle us, we might not be willing or able to ask for help from anyone else in the future.

8.) <strong>Don’t tells us what you would do</strong>. Each situation is unique, and humans are surprisingly bad at predicting how they would act in given situations. You don’t know all of the particulars, and cannot make assessments for us.

9.)<strong> If we do leave, don’t ask us why it “took so long” or why we “didn’t leave sooner.”</strong> Leaving can be hard. You have to make sure that if you leave, you have everything you need. It requires planning. Sometimes you don’t have the resources to leave. Sometimes they control the money, and you can’t guarantee that your basic needs will be met if you leave. Not at all shelters take children over a certain age or of a certain gender. Some shelters don’t take pets. Some shelters are full. Some shelters that aren’t full are long distances away. Some shelters aren’t able to accommodate people who have 3rd shift jobs. Some shelters are not accessible to public transit. Sometimes there actually isn’t a shelter. There are a lot of reasons why a person will stay with an abuser, and none of those reasons are any of your business, unless the person who is in an abusive relationship asks for your help in overcoming some of these obstacles. Until then, simple offer support unconditionally.

10. <strong>Don’t give us “tips” or “tricks” for minimizing the abuse</strong>. We, and our behavior, are not the problem. The abuser is the problem. Telling us if we would just be quieter, or to not bug the abuser while they are angry aren’t going to help up.

11.)<strong> You can ask if we reported it, or are pressing charges, but accept it if we say we didn’t, or we won’t</strong>. Yes, we know, as fellow feminists, that domestic violence and domestic abuse are under reported, and abusers rarely spend a day in jail. We know this. But we also know what we can and cannot handle, and how to best take care of ourselves. In most states there is a waiting period between when you report the abuse, and when a judge actually issues a protection order. It can be as short as a day, or as long as a few weeks. This is the most dangerous time for a survivor of abuse; this is when most survivors are killed or brutally beaten. Each survivor must decide for themselves if the thin piece of paper that is a restraining order is worth the potential outburst of homicidal rage in the abuser.

In conclusion, we KNOW that you want to help us, and we appreciate it. Really we do. And we KNOW that it’s hard to see us in this situation. But trust us when we say it’s<em> way</em> harder for us than it is for you. When we’re ready, we’ll come to you. Until then, just be there for us, in whatever way you can, in whatever way we ask, without reservations, and without judgment.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Truth About Fetal Pain, and the &quot;Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The truth is simply that fetus's cannot feel pain. Several organizations dedicated to studying obstetrics and gynecology have spent many years studying the inner working of the uterus to figure out the secrets behind pregnancy and childbirth.

Several systems must be in place in order for a fetus to feel pain, while some of these systems are developed early in a pregnancy, they aren't fully formed, and other systems haven't even begun to form yet. Pain isn't just a physical response, but also an emotional response. In order for anyone to feel pain, they need to have a developed nervous system, as well as having established connects between the nervous system and several sections of the brain. While the nervous system may begin to develop early in the first trimester, the maturation of the brain isn't something that happens until well into the third trimester. (Keep in mind that most abortions happen within the first trimester, and those that happen in the third trimester are done for the health and life of the person who is pregnant, or for severe fetal abnormalities that would make the fetus unable to live outside of the uterus.)

<!--more-->

Even in the third trimester, when all systems are finally in place around 35 - 37 weeks, the fetus will still not be able to feel any pain. The chemical environment of the uterus ensures that a fetus never experiences wakefulness, sentience, or consciousness. Instead, it is kept in an anesthetized state until shortly after birth. Most scientists believe that this is true to ensure that the fetus does not feel the pain of being born. Rather, there is a burst of chemicals released at birth that allow the now-born baby to take its experience pain, take its first breathe, digest food in a way that produces waste, and a host of other things that other born humans can do.

While some obstetricians my administer anesthesia to fetuses during pre-natal surgery, it is mostly done to make the person who is pregnant more comfortable, and assure her or him that the procedure will be painless. Further, most abortion procedures done after 14 weeks are done with the person who is pregnant being under anesthesia themselves, meaning, automatically, the fetus is also under anesthesia. And further still, procedures done in the third trimester involved the administration of digoxyn into the fetal heart on the first day of the procedure. It is not until 2 or 3 days later that the actual abortion procedure takes place, and by that point, fetal demise has occurred, meaning no matter the means of removing the fetus from the uterus, the fetus is not going to experience any pain.

Remember what I said about third trimester procedures being done to ensure the continued health and life of the person who is pregnant or in cases of severe fetal malformation? That means it is usually a wanted and desired pregnancy, and the person who is pregnant will be very, very concerned about ensuring the fetus, whom they consider a dearly loved member of the family, passes in a comfortable and pain free way.

In the United States, <em>Roe v Wade </em> prohibits bans on abortion prior to viability, the earliest limit of which is 24 weeks past a persons last menstrual period. Some are trying to challenge this by saying a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks gestation, and attempting to ban abortions prior to this point, in hopes of baiting the Supreme Court and getting more limits on Roe, as they did in <em>Planned Parenthood v Casey.</em> However, according the abstract from the<a title="fetal awareness" href="http://www.rcog.org.uk/fetal-awareness-review-research-and-recommendations-practice" target="_blank"> Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Working Paper on Fetal Awareness</a>;
<blockquote>In reviewing the neuroanatomical and physiological evidence in the fetus, it was apparent that connections from the periphery to the cortex are not intact before 24 weeks of gestation and, as most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception, it can be concluded that the fetus cannot experience pain in any sense prior to this gestation.</blockquote>
They go on to conclude that in order to experience pain, you must be be conscious. This is why you don't feel pain while you are under anesthesia.
<blockquote>After 24 weeks there is continuing development and elaboration of intracortical networks such that noxious stimuli in newborn preterm infants produce cortical responses. Such connections to the cortex are necessary for pain experience but not sufficient, as experience of external stimuli requires consciousness. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that the fetus never experiences a state of true wakefulness in utero and is kept, <em>by the presence of its chemical environment, in a continuous sleep-like unconsciousness or sedation. </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>
They go on to specifically warn against anesthetizing fetuses during surgery specifically, stating it can cause complications;
<blockquote>Furthermore, because of possible risks and difficulties in administration, fetal analgesia should not be employed where the only consideration is concern about fetal awareness or pain. Similarly, there appeared to be no clear benefit in considering the need for fetal analgesia prior to termination of pregnancy, even after 24 weeks, in cases of fetal abnormality.</blockquote>
All of this makes a compelling case against the passage of House Resolution #1797, or the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, as fetuses cannot feel pain.]]></content:encoded>

With the special session going on in Texas, and the thousands of women, men, and gender-non-conforming persons who have a uterus, and their partners, friends, and loved ones standing up for the right to have an abortion, many in Blue States are wondering "Why don't they just move?"

<!--more-->

I grew up in a blue-dog city in Pennsylvania, outside of this was rural Pennsylvania. While Pennsylvania went for Obama the last two elections, internally, much of PA is conservative. My city had an abortion clinic for a handful of months before it was driven out of town. The closest clinic was two hours away. Recently Tom Corbett has been trying to out-do Scott Walker, one-up Rick Perry, and is rolling back women's rights, slashing public education budgets, waging war against labor, and doing all he can to redraw PA districts and rig a GOP win in 2016.

After he won elections, these massive budget cuts in education meant my spouse could not afford to go to a local PASSHE (PA State System of Higher Education) for his Masters of Education, and was uncertain he would be able to get a job at the local school district afterward. He was employed in several capacities with the local school district at the time, but hoped to have a full time teaching position. Soon, deeper cuts meant his contracted positions were cut. He was unemployed, I was just out of school, and over-qualified or under-qualified for everything, and unable to find any employment.

So we fled. We moved to a solidly blue state.

But it was so incredibly tough. We had small savings, enough to pay to move what was truly important, and we though, a few months rent. To put it in perspective: when we thought we would be living in Blue Dog Land, we looked at duplexes, two bedrooms, two baths, a little bit of a shared yard, about 1,000 sqft, and they were nice apartments. The really expensive ones we looked at were $550/month. We calculated groceries to be about $100 a month, and bills/utilities (including internet and phone) around $200. We would need a combined income of $1000 a month to live comfortably. We had student debt, so we would add on a few hundred more a month, but I don't feel like telling you how much I spent, or he spent on educations. The <a href="http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/42049">living wage for two adults in this city</a> is a combined income of $27,040. Yes, jobs in Blue Dog Land don't pay as much as jobs in Big City East Coast, but the cost of living is much less, too. Comparatively,<a href="http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/24031"> the living wage where we are living now</a> is $41,600, almost double.

So while we thought we had plenty to survive on while looking for jobs In Blue State Bordering a Big City, we didn't. We found a nice apartment that was really awful to get to for $1,200/month, mostly because of how awful it was to get to.

I crashed on a friends couch for two weeks while going to interviews, and my spouse stayed in Blue Dog Land for those two weeks finishing up his contract. We thought if I found a job first, now knowing how much the cost of living was, it might be easier.

It wasn't. I found a job right away doing something I love. It took him a lot longer, and it was very difficult. We moved 7 hours away from both of our home towns, from both of our families, from both of our support systems. We only had each other. And when we were mad at each other, we had no one. I took a second job while he was still looking for his first, and that meant I had to take the subway very late at night, and then walk some very sketchy roads for a mile around midnight, as the busses stopped running. I was resentful, and wanted to move back in with his parents at times while making this trip.

We made it, yes, we are happy, and living in a wonderful location with our cats and an amazing roommate.

But we have an incredible amount of privilege, and made a lot of sacrifices not everyone is able to make, nor should be required to make to obtain basic human rights. We are both white, and college educated. We had a small savings account to live off of while struggling. We gave up our community, we gave up seeing our families with any regularity, we gave up our home town, we gave up our sense of belonging, we gave up treasured places. We cannot visit often, and our parents cannot visit us often. Luckily our parents are healthy, and do not need us at home to take care of them. We are currently both able-bodied and able to work, and do not need financial help from our parents.

But for some people, leaving their home and moving to a state that is more friendly to their rights is not an option. Finding a new job can be impossible, elder-care makes leaving impossible, the thought of removing your children from their best friends breaks your heart, you don't have the money to move, ect. And you shouldn't have to leave your roots, your community, because some assholes in your legislature want to control your body. Your rights should not be dependent on your location.

And I feel guilty as hell. I feel cowardly at times, as I see women's health centers across PA brace for the TRAP laws. I get angry as hell as I see the school districts cut arts, and do away with field trips. And I turned my back on the women and men fighting those battles; because it was too hard.

I get to sit back, knowing if I divorced my spouse, I, being queer and pan, could easily, in Maryland, marry anyone else with whom I might fall in love. I can walk into a women's health center, ask for birth control not have an eye be bat. If I needed an abortion, I would not be subjected to a mandatory lecture, and I could get one same day. I don't have to fight for my rights here.

That should be the case no matter where one lives. When I lived in "flyover country" I was no less of a queer woman who might need abortion services and workers rights protections. And those who live in Texas are no less deserving of their rights. "Just moving" isn't an option for many people. It reeks of privilege when you tell the progressives in Red States to "just move." It reeks of privilege when you tell those who don't identify politically with a party, or cause, to just move when something real and pressing to their lives comes to the legislature, and they protest, that maybe they should just move. They might not have the means, and they might not want to move. So stop saying it, and start supporting them. You shouldn't have to give up your roots to gain your rights.]]></content:encoded>

As someone who never felt at home in her own flyover state (but who has at many times been subject to counseling and cajoling to move back there), this post definitely resonates with me. 

I currently live in a blue part of a rather purple state, and I feel like I can really do some good here in terms of protecting women's reproductive health. I won't lie, however, and say that part of me stays here because of how blue my current area is (well, minus the mind-boggling actions of a nearby zoning committee last week), which makes me feel just a tad bit guilty. Could I be putting my organizing and wonky talents to better use in my home red state?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>New Year, New Blog Topics: Coding While Feminist</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello -

I hope y’all had a good holiday and are no longer hungover from new year celebrations! I wanted to let you all know that there might be some new content here. I’ve taken a small detour into coding and web development, and want to document this journey in this space. All my reproductive rights/justice and feminism content will now be found under the “feminism” category, and all my coding content can be found under the “coding” category. Use the navigation to select which ones you want to read! I hope you find that you want to read both, as I’m finding there is a lot of cool topics to talk about while coding while feminist and while feministing while tech.

Thanks!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Very Short Introduction</title>
		<link>http://www.nikkilizmurray.com/a-very-short-introduction/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wanted to take a few moments to discuss how I got into coding and what I'm doing so far/have learned so far! A way long back, in high school, my computer science teacher decided teaching HTML was way more important than going on and on and on and on about Microsoft Office. So we built a website, and we made pac-man. Of course, I only used these skills for the most pure of purposes: a fan-site with auto-play music dedicated to <em>The Last Unicorn</em>.

Fast-forward ten years, and I somehow end up at a ruby meet up and am soon writing a small program to make my cats cuddles with each other (something they do on command in this program, something they do only when the fancy strikes them in real life). I start playing around on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a>, and decide I want to get serious about this. Since then I've been vacillating between <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a>, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, and <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>. I'll be attending <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/back-end-web-development">General Assembly's Back-End Web Development</a> course in two weeks!

<!--more-->

So far through the various means I've learned a bit more HTML, a lot of CSS, JavaScript, and picked up bits here and there of how Ruby differs from other programing languages. I've learned how to use command line better, the importance of version control, git and gitHub, that "cat" has nothing to do with cats, the animals, and everything to do with concatenating.

I'll be posting later about the various tutorials/guides I've been using, what I liked and didn't like, problems I got stuck on, and questions that baffled me (still baffle me?).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>So how does a computer know programming languages? Does it have to go to college?</title>
		<link>http://www.nikkilizmurray.com/so-how-does-a-computer-know-programming-languages/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A question that bothered me A LOT when I first started was how does a computer know programming languages? How does it learn new languages? When Ruby was made, did every person have to take their computer back to college and make it get a major in Ruby?

This question, though presented very comically, really really bothered me. The answers I got were either overly technical to the point that I thought the person explaining it was trying more to show off than actually teach me, or very much along the lines of "well, it's magic, and it really doesn't matter, as long as it works."

I like my witches and wizards doing magic, I like my computers doing something comprehensible and understandable.

<!--more-->

I decided to embarrass myself in front of and make myself look like an idiot to my mentor. Because, really, I wasn't getting anywhere with getting the answer to this question. What was she going to do? Tell me to never code again? I was really silly for letting my pride get in the way for a long time.

Part of my learning process, small digression, is hearing it put one way, and trying to find another way to explain it and explain it back to the person teaching me in this other way.

So she explained that the computer really only knows one language, Assembly, and there are either compilers or interpreters that translate whatever language we are coding in to Assembly. So anyone who wants to invent a new language can, but they would either have to also create the interpreter or compiler, or find someone else to do it before the computer can read it.

So I explained it back like this: So the computer is an American.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today's Question That Bothered Me a LOT While Getting Into Coding: I'm Too Cool for Mac's/I Like Being Able to Play A Lot Of Video Games on My Computer/I Work For A Nonprofit And My Cats Have Expensive Tastes, So Really, What I'm Trying To Say Is I Can't Afford a Mac, Please Tell Me They Aren't Required?

The answer, I learned, is that they aren't!

<!--more-->

Traditionally, I learned, Ruby doesn't run well on Windows. Also, Window's is a different kind of operating system from what Mac's run on. Mac's run on POSIX compliant OS's. Windows is not POSIX compliant. POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface [for Unix]) is a set of standards about how operating systems run. HOWEVER, as I happily learned, Linux operating systems (most of them, anyways) ARE POSIX-ish! I happened to have a very small netbook I bought to do study abroad with, it was cheap, as I learned, because it came with Ubuntu (a linux OS), and Ubuntu is free. I had to quickly teach myself the very basics of owning a linux computer. Not enough to program with, but enough to figure out how to install open office (I had no clue what sudo apt-get install OpenOffice <em>meant</em>, just that the tutorial online told me this was how I get it. So I did it). So I was already familiar with Linux, and knew that I could partition a device to run two operating systems, and hey, Ubuntu is <em>free. </em>I also learned that you can find some pretty nice Chromebooks for relatively reasonable prices if you look at sites that sell recertified/refurbished Chromebooks. So I picked up a Samsung Chromebook and used this guide to get Ubunutu onto it.

I then command line installed <a href="https://rvm.io/">Ruby Version Manager</a>, Rails, and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and POOF. I had a computer that could do some development things for less than $200 and without putting my cats out of their top notch cat nip.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>I have to interact with people? The importance of groups in learning coding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you read my intro post, you'll know I got started at a meet up. My first meet up was with the <a href="http://railsgirls.com/dc">DC Rails Girls</a>. I now regularly attend the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/">DC RUG</a> meet ups and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Learn-Ruby-in-DC/">Learn Ruby</a> meet ups.  You can use Meetup.com to find groups in your area! Also, some cool companies host their own meet ups. If there is a company you want to work for, even if you aren't at a level you feel is good enough, email them to ask if they have regular happy hours or meet ups for those wanting to get into the tech world.

These meet-ups have been super useful for asking questions, getting answers, and in general finding my feet in the coding world. I've had a lot of problems with not feeling like I'm learning enough, learning fast enough, etc (and aka imposter syndrome). For the most part these meet ups have shown me that everyone is still learning, and that no matter the level you are at, there is still more to learn.

<!--more-->

For those wanting to know: yes, I've run into some assholes who've attended more to show off than learn. I suppose you run into that in any group of people (I know my college was full of them).  If you're just getting into code, especially if you are a woman, I highly recommend going to a meet up! Or a few! Or a lot! If you are nervous about it, find a friend to go with you. As tutorials become outdated, or new features come up, having someone to explain why your code won't execute is really helpful when google is not being so. Some of the people at the meet ups I go to are learning Ruby, but have several years of experience in other languages; some are like me and just getting started. Almost all of them are willing to answer what my questions!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My decision to go to General Assembly</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My decision to attend a non-accredited school to learn more about coding is many faceted. I looked at a lot of coding schools, and I looked at how long they lasted, what the hours were, how much they cost and did I have to relocate to attend.

I suppose I could break this down to a.) why I chose to go to a devboot-camp-esque school to continue my learning and b.) why I chose General Assembly specifically.

<!--more-->

To answer why I chose to go to a school, broadly speaking has a lot to do with <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/you-say-you-want-diversity-but-we-cant-even-get-internships">this Model View Culture article</a>.

In the article, Anna states how she is going to a job fair, looking for an internship.
<blockquote>But when I asked about internship opportunities, the company representatives said no right away, or, assuming I was a CS student, asked me “What year are you?”<strong> When I told them I was self-taught, I was out</strong>. Other companies just wanted me to sign up for their newsletters, just a cheap marketing strategy, or a way of being nice. People weren’t interested in reading my CV. Out of thirty copies I had printed out, I gave out two. Some people advised me straight away to try “one of those programs designed for women.” They didn’t even listen to me. They saw that I was a woman, a beginner, looking for an opportunity to learn, and clearly not someone they would want to hire.</blockquote>
(emphasis mine)

She goes on to say
<blockquote><strong>Being self-taught is accepted and even highly respected when you’re a white male. If you are a woman or belong to other underrepresented groups, it’s totally different.</strong> Besides being experienced you need to have a blog, website, GitHub account and contribute to open source. A recruiter once told me that if a candidate doesn’t have all of those things, they wonder whether that person is <i>really</i> willing to learn. That statement made me angry – who came up with these requirements? And who benefits from them?</blockquote>
(emphasis mine)

So, if I was not going to be respected as a self-taught coder, what could I do about it? It's a situation that a lot of white cis straight men do not have to think about. A lot of them I've encountered online have boasted of quitting their job to learn code at home full time. I've often wondered how they afford that. I certainly cannot. I have a full time job, and it pays the bills. My savings could not support me while I take a year off.

As stated, I can't quit my day job, so that left getting (another) bachelors out of the question. I already did that college thing, I'm not in any hurray to do it again - the food just wasn't that good. So I could do one of those boot camps, maybe? I found a free one in NYC, that even offered a small grant for living expenses, but it would involve moving, and possibly finding a place that allowed cats (cats are important!) and figuring out a lot of logistics that seemed very impossible to me. Then I was looking at the Big Names, and all the 12 week immersives were $11,000 - $15,000. I already did the college thing, I'm still paying loans on that. Those $$$ look very large to me. In addition, it would involve leaving my day job. Even if these schools promised help in the form of having partnerships with companies that hire fresh grads, I still needed to eat every day.

So one day I stumbled on General Assembly's night courses. It's a twice weekly course in Back-End Web Development, it's in the evenings after work. I will be able to keep my day job, and get the stamp of approval in a formal manner. I do not want to run into any roadblocks from people not thinking I am qualified as a result of their internal prejudice*.

(These biases* are often unconscious, and they do not necessarily mean you are an evil person. Having them means you are human, and currently uneducated in this area -which is ok, battling unconscious biases is not something we are taught in school, and it is a lifelong process - I am not here to bash anyone or yell at anyone - I am here to explain what I've been told about getting to be a woman in tech and why I made the educational choices I made!)

		<title>Review of Queen of the Tearling</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>[Note: I read this book this past summer, and posted a review on my dreamwidth, I'd like to post it here as I realized I was going to compile a short review post of books I read this past year. I decided my short review of Queen of the Tearling would have no weight without this review I wrote about 60% of the way through the book.]</em>

I am always looking for books featuring strong female protagonists. Not "strong" as in "beats people up and eats their bones" (although, I like that a lot), but strong as in well-developed and well-plotted character arc. I've seen a few people compare <i>Queen of the Tearling</i> to <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, as well as<em> Hunger Games</em>, and<em> A Girl of Fire and Thorns</em>. Almost all of them claim that this is no young adult fantasy, and that it contains violence and languange that isn't necessarily suitable for "young adults" (and Hunger Games was because...?). However, I am 64% of the way through it, and I am not enjoying it.

<!--more-->

I would compare it more to<em> Legend of the Seeker </em>in the style of prose, and in the fact that the MC is clearly an author stand in for political views. While<em> Legend of the Seeker</em> grated on me for the 100 pages I did read due to its conservative bent, I expected I would eventually like the more socialist bent of Tearling. Not so. Dry prose that attempts to proselytize is dull prose either way.

The four big concerns I have with the politics, however, I feel deserve their own section.

OBLIGATORY SPOILER WARNING.

<strong>Sex Work</strong>

There are two kinds of sex work presented in the book. The first is that of sex slavery. The Regent has an extensive collection of women whom he thinks he is giving everything to, but are more of collectors pieces then humans to him. The second is the workers of "The Gut" or "The Blue District."

Upon Kelsea learning of the first, she immediately began to think of ways to rescue the poor women her uncle kept in captivity. Upon learning of the second, she immediately started thinking of ways to make her socialist paradise so that the women could get "real jobs" (yes, that is a quote from the book.) She also briefly thought of criminalizing sex work before the voice of her guardian told her it was wrong to legislate morality.

Kelsea "freed" the "harem" her uncle collected (again, books wording). The one woman, Marguerite, was recruited into Kelsea's household to be a nurse and babysitter to her ladies-in-waiting children. In one scene, the Regent comes back and sees her, and she comes and sits at the foot of Kelsea's throne like she used to do for the Regent. She isn't given a motive for this, or asked to explain this act, and Kelsea finds it weird. Kelsea also is baffled that Marguerite has the ability to be good with children and speak other languages. Since Kelsea is supposed to be a moral center of the book, the reader is also supposed to find this strange, and weird, and definitely not the norm. This sets Marguerite up to be The Model Sex Worker, or The Exception, not like those Other sex workers.

The reader also has contact with another "freed harem girl" who is seen to be telling the Regent off after her freeing, but is very concerned with the fact that her jewelry has been confiscated by The Crown. SHe is set up as a foil to Marguerite. Yes, she is happy she isn't the property of the Regent anymore, but, ultimately, the reader is supposed to deduce that her complaint was that occassionally the Regent made her "lick Petra's cunt" rather than all the pretty baubles she was given. She tells the Regent that she's found a home at some other nobels place, but doesn't elaborate what this position entails, and the reader is left to guess that it is sex work, still, as she is not given any other abilities or talents. Further, it was not she who sought out this new employment, but this other noble lord who asked her to come to him. Thus, she is still not a player in her own life, she is still without agency.

The last sex worker we meet is not given a name. She works in The Gut, and has no history, no story, no motivations. Thorne, a very important power broker, and, at this point, suspected to be a Big Bad, arranges to meet a very depressed gate guard at a bar. He talks this sex worker into poisoning the gate guards drink. Possibly bribes, very probably threatened. But somehow, he makes her an accomplice in his scheming. When the poisoned gate guard learns of this, she skrieks with laughter. I can only assume this is meant to convey the sex workers of The Gut to be nameless, opportunistic, and amoral.

While we might have been told as readers we could, if we wanted to, sympathize with the Regents "harem," we should feel no such thing for those who voluntarily chose to do sex work.

<strong>Race</strong>

The entire premise of this novel is that this is taking place in the future. SOMETHING bad happened, and all the Americans and Britains LEFT on a ship. To somewhere? Maybe it was a spaceship? Maybe it was a water ship? Either way, some new land was found (or was it? No mention of there being native peoples on this land has happened so far, but, welp, the British kinda don't like mentioning native peoples and just kinda genocide them) and now they have somehow forgotten half of technology. However, despite the fact that, currently, America and England are not 100% white, the population of this nation, Tear, is so far all white save 2 men. There is another country that is largely inhabitaed by people of color.

This means that: 1.) Only white people moved, and this other country is comprised of people who were native to the land or 2.) everyone moved but segregated afterward, and it's wishy washy on if there were native peoples.

This issue gets further complicated when one takes the authors remarks on the inspiration for this novel at face value. She claims she was inspired to write about an idealist who does manage to gain political power after watching a 2007 speech given by Barack Obama. Which...idealist isn't the word I would use to describe him, but that is aside from the point. The point is that the main character, and all people she looks up to for guidance and support, idealist or not, are white. Your inspiration was a black man. See the problem?
I posted on twitter about this, but there is a lack of people of color.

<strong>EBooks</strong>

The characters of the book posit that aside from a ship full of medical knowledge not making it, the major loss of knowledge comes from the fact that in the future book publishing does not exist because of ebooks. Publishing, here, to mean, the physical making of a book via printing press. Because everyone has ebooks, somehow this knowledge is lost, and when the emigrate to this new land, there aren't many physical books to bring, and none of them happen to contain how to make more books. So the evil ebooks have caused the world to revert to medieval Europe, complete with fiefdoms and lords and ladies and monarchs.

I love my ereader. That is all I feel I should have to say on the subject.

<strong>Femininity</strong>

I am all for a heroine who isn't feminine. I am all for a heroine who is plain, or dowdy, or fat, or not classically beautiful. I love Alanna, who, while "passable" (according to George's mother), mostly eschews dresses except for fun. I love Elisa, who is fat, and not afraid to embrace it. Yes, she loses a little weight while traveling among the Malefico, but she is still large, and does not let it concern her.

However, in this book, Kelsea, and, I assume, the author, broadly paint femininity as wrong. Elissa was concerned with dresses and hair, and that made her a bad ruler. The woman whom Kelsea takes a tiara from is called "a hussy" by Kelsea herself. Carlin chastises Kelsea for putting on a gown, and Kelsea later thinks very highly of Carlin for steering her away from gowns. Dresses are outright equated with vanity.

I am happy to have a heroine who wears armor and wields a sword. However, when Kelsea, and the entire cast of characters whom we are supposed to respect, consistently paint any signs of femininity as wrong and frivolous, it seems, frankly, misogynistic.

The patriarchy favors men who act out and perform a certain type of masculinity. While effeminate men might be able to have a little privilege, they are not afford the same degree and amount of privilege as men who are very masculine. Femininity is seen as weak, docile, and incompetent and unsuited for any major decision making.

This patriarchal line of thinking is carried throughout even if it is a woman espousing these views.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night was my first night at General Assembly's back end web development course. The weather attempted to stop it, but despite the impending blizzard and the ice and snow it threw at us, we were able to have class as planned.

The various staff of GA introduced themselves, and explained how they could help us. I'm not very good at names/faces, so we will see how well I do when I need to actually ask for something!

We started off with an explanation of what the internet is, and how it works. For the purposes of retaining information, I will be regurgitating some of it here. SORRY NOT SORRY.

<!--more-->

It was explained to us by steps. There is a user, who sits in front of a computer. This computer is connected to a modem or a wifi hotspot. This connects to the internet, the maintenance of which is up to the service providers. It is then connected to the server of the website the user is trying to get to. A server is just a fancy word for a computer that runs the programs/codes. The internet sends you to the server via the domain name. Every domain name is assigned to an IP address which points to that server. The controller at the server gets the model, which is connected to a database, and a view. So a user types in www.domainname.com/specific_page and that request is sent through the previously explained path. The internet handles the domain name, the server handles the /specific_page part (which is called a route). Once that request is recieved, the server sends a response, and a webpage appears in the browser.

Since this is a "back end" course, it will focus on the part after the internet sends the request to the server.

With that out of the way, we moved into using the command line in a unix OS. I've already done a lot with command line via <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations" target="_blank">treehouse </a>and this was mostly a review for me. However, the exercise we did was much much more geeky. It involved creating the directories of Alderaan, and Deathstar, and putting .voice's on Alderaan and vader on the deathstar and force removing the Alderaan directory. Well, yes. I suppose as long as we have equal representation of Star Wars and Star Trek in our exercises I'll be fine. Once we were all comfortable with the basic's of the command line, we moved on to learning Ruby!

This was also a review for me, having gone through a lot of online classes and tutorials in Ruby. We went over strings, numbers, booleans, and variables. The instructors said that this fast pace was designed to make us learn, to extend ourselves, and to develop a "growth mind-set." If I wasn't already familiar with these concepts I might have felt a little overwhelmed. If you are a raw beginner and have never even looked at an intro to programming, I might suggest doing so before taking this course.

There was an install fest on Sunday, which I had to miss because sometimes you totally mis-understand how a car sharing app works, and sometimes the support person can't help you when the car itself is broke. It seemed to be ok, though. I already had RVM, Rails, and Sublime Text 3 on my linux machine, and luckily I already had the one gem they wanted to use yesterday (pry, the gem is pry and it is a really cool gem that lets you stop the code after a certain point to see how it works; we just used it to play around with strings and variables and booleans).

I'm hoping there isn't going to be much boolean. Or maybe I am hoping there will be a bi more, as I'm not very good at the logic part of boolean. I didn't take a logic class in college, I took an epistemology class (I'm still waiting for it to be applicable in life, but to be fair I'm still waiting for a lot of my courses to be applicable.)

Since I last posted, I also created a twitter bot that posts pictures of my cats: @NikkisCats - I'm getting around to posting a blogpost about it as soon as I get it on github. Please look forward to it!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Day Two At General Assembly: Learning Git and Github</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today in my Back-End Web Development course we went over git, github, and loops in ruby.

Again, this was mostly review for me, except for the github part. Treehouse has a pretty good course on version control and git, and skims over github. I knew I had to have one, and that I could store stuff there, and other people could contribute, but there was a lot of finer details that were lost on me.

<!--more-->

Ex: forking a repository to have your own version, and committing to that, but being able to still pull from the original repository you forked from. I think I can use this to help me compile my cat bot for github. My catbot, the end result of which is found on twitter @NikkisCats, forked a twitter bot. This original twitter bot would create tweets from your own twitter archive. But I wanted a bot that would tweet random pictures. So I forked it to my respository, and then downloaded it and added new code to have it pull a random picture from the bucket i had on AWS, then tweet it. I've been confused on how to properly attribute the original repository and still have my own code available. I think the things I learned today would help me compile everything neatly and get that up this weekend.

For those who don't know, git is a way to do version control. Have you ever gotten an email with an attachment that is named "Important_document_final_with_PRs_edits_PLUS_approval_for_real_final_version_NO_REALLY"? Cause I get that one a lot. Then, of course, while you are editing the afore mentioned document, someone else starts to edit it, too? and you end up with two totally different versions? git is a cool way handle that problem when doing development.

gitHub is a graphical user interface laid overtop of git. Most of git is done in the command line. You create a local folder, and point it toward a repository. Other people can then check out what you "pushed" to the repository, but "pulling" a copy down from the repository. They can then edit it, and push the edit's back up. git will check which files were added, which were changed, and merge those changes. If there is a conflict, it will let you know. This all happens in the command line. gitHub gives you a more visual way of checking what is in the repository, who has made edits, what those edits where, and other information. gitHub also allows you to edit stuff right there in the browser.

<em>This is meant for informational purposes only, and is not an endorsement of gitHub. I encourage my readers to research the business and hiring practices of gitHub and examine them <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=sexism+github#" target="_blank">from a feminist lens</a>. </em>

We then learned about while and if loops in Ruby. While and if loops are an extension of some logic, if this, do that, else, if that, do this. While this, keep doing that. You can check out some of the exercises we did in class <a href="https://github.com/jdax/BEWD_DC_JAN2015/blob/master/class02/nikki/guess.rb" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jdax/BEWD_DC_JAN2015/blob/master/class02/nikki/vote.rb" target="_blank">here.</a>

(Yes, jdax as in Jadzia Dax, as in, the best Dax.)

Again, most of this was review for me, but I firmly believe the more times you are exposed to a concept or an idea, the more you understand it and the easier it is.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I accidentally (no, really) didn't read any works of fiction by a single man this year. Some of those books were awful/hilarious, some of them were really good. I already blogged about the absolute most irritating book I read in 2014 (<a title="Review of Queen of the Tearling" href="http://nikkilizmurray.com/2015/01/11/review-of-queen-of-the-tearling/">here</a>), but here are some of the highlights, in no particular order!

<!--more-->

<em>The Lunar Chronicles (Cinders, Scarlet, Cress)</em> -  - Marissa Meyer - This is candy, but it's pretty good candy. It's part Sailor Moon fanfiction, part "fairy tails re-told" and also part post-apocalyptic-ish.

<em>The Summer Prince -  </em>Alaya Dawn Johnson - Race, class, and age play a huge part in this novel. Future matriarchal Brazil with a poly, queer love triangle and a protagonist with a bisexual mother? Please!

<em>The Drowning Girl - </em>Caitlin Kiernan - Possibly triggering! Possibly a ghost story, possibly the story of a woman's battle with a mental illness, definitely has a trans woman as one of the main characters.<em>
</em>

<em>Scale-Bright - </em><span class="st">Benjanun Sriduangkaew - Both prose and poetry, a twist on Chinese myth with lots of lesbians, and straddling both heaven and earth, human and in-. </span><em>
</em>

<em>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Making - </em>Catherynne M. Valente - A very dangerous Fairyland, with a heroine who learns to stand on her own and an obligatory magical creature cast.<em>
</em>

<em>The Girl Who Fell Beneath Fairyland and Lead the Revels There - </em>Catherynne M. Valente - Like the first of the series, but with some interesting subtext and text about the importance of consent.<em>
</em>

<em>Howls Moving Castle  - </em>Diane Wynne Jones- Re-read - Still as fun as the first time I read it, still infinitely more rich than that Miyazaki film.

<em>Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</em> - N.K. Jemisin -Re-read - If gods fashioned humans after themselves, how fucked up must gods be? Even knowing the answer beforehand, I was still shocked on the re-read.

<em>Seven Things Cadet Blanchard Learned from the Trade Summit Incident</em> - Annalee Flower Horne -Short Story - Clever, hilarious, plus fart jokes. Good world building, and believably done in few words. An evil company, a smart cadet, and fart jokes.

<em>One True Love</em> - Malinda Lo - Short Story - Heart-wrenching. I was getting my hair done when I read it, so I couldn't tear my hair out during the sad part. Plus, lesbians, an evil step-dad, and a damsel in the tower!

On my list for this year, for those who want to read along with me:

Seraphina, Alcestis, Fairest, Ascension, The Archer Who Shot Down the Suns, The Girl Who Soared Over Fairyland and Cut the Moon in Two, Re-Read: Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, Grave Mercy, The Killing Moon, The Goldfinch, Shadow and Bone, Re-Read the Girl of Fire and Thorns, Re-Read: Liliths Brood, Adaptation, and any other things my friends/family may publish!

		<title>Build Another Pyramid with Ruby</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This past week in coding I got my cat bot up to github! You can now make <a href="https://github.com/jdax/twitter_cat_bot" target="_blank">your very own cat bot</a>! I tried to make it as accessible as possible to the non-programmer as possible. Please let me know in some form if you have questions or comments! I guess, if you really wanted to, for some reason I cannot fathom, wanted to make a bunny bot or a dog bot or a ferret bot. I don't know, I guess you could do that.

This past week in class we did if loops, while loops, arrays, hashes and enumeration.

<!--more-->

<strong>If loops/while loops</strong>

If and while loops help you to not repeat code, or to make sure that only specific parts of your code run if certain conditions are met. So 'if this, than that" would be the plain English of an if loop. "While this is going on, or while this is true, keep doing that" is the plain English for a while loop. For our homework we were asked to design pyramids to certain user defined specifications. We had to ask which character the user wanted to build the ASCII pyramid with, how many rows they wanted, and if they wanted it right-side-up, or up-side down. Obviously I had "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qduQyu-Cxgc" target="_blank">Another Pyramid</a>" stuck in my head the whole time I was working on this. This requires that you nest a while loop in an if loop.

In order to keep the "customers" height requirment, you have to keep count of how many times you run the code. So you set up a counter, and /while/ the counter is equal to or less than the customers specified height, you run the code. The if loop is used to determine <em>which </em>type of code you run: the code that will build the pyramid the right way up, or upside down.
<blockquote># getting architectural specifications for the pyramid
puts "Please pick a character with which to build a pyramid"
building_block = gets.chomp

puts "How tall, in rows, would you like this pyramid to be?"
height = gets.chomp.to_i

puts "Do you want to defy gravity? Y/N?"
physics = gets.chomp.upcase
# counter, if loop/while loop

counter = 1

if physics == "N"
while counter &lt;= height
puts " " * (height - counter) + building_block * (counter * 2 - 1)
counter +=1
end
elsif physics == "Y"
while counter &lt;= height
puts " " * (counter + height) + building_block * (2 * (height - counter) + 1)
counter += 1
end
end</blockquote>
<strong>Arrays, Hashes, Ennumeration</strong>

Arrays and hashes are ways of collecting and storing multiple types of data. Both can store <i>strings, numbers, symbols, booleans, </i>and even arrays and hashes. Arrays are ordered lists. When you create one, the order in which you put the data is assigned an index. The index starts at 0.
<blockquote>this_is_my_array = ["string", 1, true]</blockquote>
So in the above array, string is index 0. It can be accessed with array[0].

You can add objects to an array by using the .push method.
<blockquote>this_is_my_array.push("new object")</blockquote>
This will add the "new object" string to the end of the current array, at index 3. You can also insert a new object by assigning it an index that may or may not be currently in use.
<blockquote>this_is_my_array[0] = "Thirteen"</blockquote>
The above would put "Thirteen" at the start, and move everything over by one.

Some other methods you might want to use on an array:
<blockquote>.pop
.uniq
.sample (this is how I built my cat bot!)
.shuffle (yes, like your playlist)
.first
.last
.sort
.reverse
.join
.split</blockquote>
All of the above will make a copy of the array, and then make changes on it. If you want to permanently alter your array, you can add a ! to the end of the method. This is called the bang method.

Hashes are unordered, so there is no index. You access the data in them via keys. Each key is assigned to a value. In some other programming languages they are called "associative arrays" as the data has association to it. Hashes also commonly use symbols. Symbols are like smaller strings, they take less time to run. Instead of being noted "like this" they are notated :like_this. The difference is that symbols are immutable.
<blockquote>this_is_my_hash { :key_one =&gt; "value_one", :key_two =&gt; "value_two"}

hash_of_peoples_favorite_animal { :nikki =&gt; "cat", :liz =&gt; "rabbit", :megan =&gt; "crab" }</blockquote>
The =&gt; is called a hash rocket. Idk why. I guess someone thinks it looks like a rocket.

If you wanted to access information from a hash you would type
<blockquote>hash_of_peoples_favorite_animals[:nikki]</blockquote>
or to put a new key and value into a hash:
<blockquote>hash_of_people_favorite_animals[:hannah] = "dog"</blockquote>
Most of the method's you can call on an array can also use on hash's, save the ones that might require order (such as .first, .last).

We also went over .each and .map, ways in which to sort information into arrays or break out information from an array.

cats = ["Didi", "Tom", "Stormy"]

So say I wanted each of my cats to meow. I could write this:
<blockquote>cats.each do |cat|
puts "#{cat} meows."
end</blockquote>
What this does is temporarily assign each object in the array to the new 'cat' variable then runs it through the code. So it will return:
<blockquote>Didi meows.
Tom meows.
Stormy meows.</blockquote>
But say I wanted to put the results of the .each into an array of it's own. I could use the .map method.
<blockquote>cats_meowing = cats.map do |cat|
puts "#{cat} meows"
end</blockquote>
So cats_meowing will now be an array looking like this:

["Didi meows", "Tom meows", "Stormy meows"]

Leave comments/corrections/critiques/criticisms/compliments in the comments section! Before doing so, you might want to read my <a title="On Comment Policies and Free Speech" href="http://nikkilizmurray.com/2013/05/03/on-comment-policies-and-free-speech/" target="_blank">comment policy.</a> Because I sometimes write about my feminism here, too, and sometimes receive hateful comments, I ask you to keep this in mind. I am learning ruby/programming right now, and do not know all the things there is to know.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Note: possible spoilers for <em>Seraphina</em>]

[caption id="attachment_751" align="alignleft" width="183"]<a href="http://www.nikkilizmurray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Seraphina.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-751" src="http://www.nikkilizmurray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Seraphina.jpg" alt="Seraphina" width="183" height="275" /></a> Cover art for Seraphina[/caption]

My friend <a title="Uncorked, Unwrapped" href="http://www.uncorkedunwrapped.com" target="_blank">Liz</a> has been recommending <em>Seraphina </em>by Rachel Hartman for some time now, and it's just been sitting on my kindle waiting to be read. So I decided to make it the first book of 2015! For those who don't want spoilers, I will say that I didn't feel it lived up to the hype, or its own potential.  The start of the book had some nice world building, there were themes brought up that I thought would be touched on later in the novel, but these never showed up again.

The basically {SPOILERS} plot of the novel is that the world was beset by dragons, and after a long war, the dragons and humans came to an unsteady peace. The humans religion is distrustful of dragons, and see's the dragons, and copulating with them, sinful. Dragons seek wisdom, and to be logical and reasonable, without emotion. Much like the Vulcans. The book starts, literally, with the birth of Seraphina. She brings up that she was assigned two patron saints, one without a head, and one a heretic. The first chapter spends a bit of time discussing these two saints, but they are, unfortunately, never touched on again. I felt let down, as by the time I had finished the book I'd forgotten all about them. As I was skimming through the book afterward to find some examples for this review I stumbled back upon them.

<!--more-->

Soon after Seraphina is born her mother, of course, dies. We learn her mother was a dragon. In this world, dragons can disguise themselves as humans. There are usually tell-tale signs, however, that they are not. And in case there weren't, dragons wear bells. Frequently the word "passing" was brought up regarding a dragon being able to look human enough to fool people. The connotation I most associate with "passing" is a trans persons ability to "pass" as a cis person, or for them to not be mistaken as the gender that they are not. Here it was employed by most humans as deceptive, or dishonest. While the protagonist, being half-dragon herself, clearly is not prejudiced or biased against dragons, the rest of the human world usually is. Furthermore, it very much felt that the dragon/human divide was meant to be an allegory for racism. This mixing of words, in my head, of racial prejudice and transphobia took me out of the story.

As part-dragon, Seraphina has scales. But she also has visions that are, at first, uncontrollable. The way it was described it the book, to me I understood it as the visions were accompanied by seizures. Seraphina then spends a lot of time making a mental garden and the 'characters' from her visions are attached to certain parts of her garden. This sounded to me a lot like a way one might attempt to control panic attacks or other manifestations of mental illness. At first I was thinking that this was a heroine with a disability, with a mental illness, and this was how she coped with it. But as it turns out, this is because the characters in her visions are all other half-dragons, and the visions were her spying on them in a way. So it wasn't a disability, it was a super power. One she must, at the end of the novel, use to locate the rest of the people like her in order to hopefully stop a war. This disappointed me.

Seraphina has two of the best friends in the world. They happen to both be of the royal bloodline, and also engaged to each other. Because this is YA, she must obviously fall in love with one of them. This will obviously need to be kept secret from the other. She will obviously fight against this crush until she cannot anymore, and the one she loves will obviously love her back.

She, obviously, fell in love with the man. This, obviously, disappointed me.

All in all, I would say <em>Seraphina</em> is a straightforward 'save the world as the Chosen One' YA fantasy, I didn't find in it anything groundbreaking. It tried, I felt, too hard and failed to be ground-breaking in area's. The Completely Different Species as a Stand In for Racism never works, and it certainly doesn't work when you make the other species shape-shifters. It really does not work when you borrow words from other social justice struggles and try to use them to describe your fantasy social justice struggles.

		<title>There&#039;s a method for that!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry for the long pause in the coding related content! The reason is that I moved my blog from wordpress.com to self-hosted and running on wordpress.org.  The move has allowed for a lot more customization and a lot more control over my content, including the ability to create my own themes. I'm still using my old one while I design the new theme, but be on the lookout!

<!--more-->

For those of you unfamiliar with Ruby, but familar with other languages, a<strong> method</strong> is like a function in some other languages like JavaScript. A method is a re-usable block of code. You might have already used a standard Ruby method like .upcase. A big concept in Ruby is "DRY" which means "don't repeat yourself."  You create a method that you can use on an object by doing the following:

def method_name(arguments)
#code that you want to run
end

So for example, say you have an object  cat:

cat = gets.chomp

and you want it to meow. You can create a method for that.

def meow    return "meow's"
end

So now you can go cat.meow and it should return the cat meowing.  You can now use this piece of code you wrote elsewhere.  You can also create a method with arguments.

def cat(name, toy)
return "#{name} plays with #{toy}. Meow!"
end

This bit of code won't run if you don't give it both of the arguments, though. If you forget to put in a toy argument, Ruby will tell you there is an argument error. To avoid this, you can set defaults.

def cat(name, toy="yarn")
return "#{name} plays with #{toy}. Meow!"
end

So now even if someone doesn't specify the toy, Ruby will put "yarn" as the toy automatically!

You might have noticed I'm using "return" instead of "puts." Return ends the method and breaks out of it, puts does not. Return sends us something from our code, whereas puts does not affect our code, and is more like a message to ourselves in the console.  This is important when you are working with numbers, if you wanted a method that adds to numbers and returns the results.

One thing to keep in mind is that method's are like black boxes. If you've worked in other programming languages, you might know about a concept called scope. <strong>Scope</strong> is a way of talking about who knows what and where in your code. If you create a variable on line 12, does the code you are running on line 45 know about that variable?  If you create a variable in a method, that variable is not accessible outside of running that method. On the flip side of that, a method cannot reference variables outside of it. However, a method CAN reference another method, but since Ruby runs line by line, that method must have been defined before it can be referenced in another method.

		<title>So what&#039;s the big deal about object oriented programming?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are multiple approaches to writing code. Functional, procedural, and object-oriented are three of the most common. If you are learning Ruby, you need to know about object oriented programming. The previous posts all included examples of procedural code. Procedural code is code that runs line by line and does one task at a time, each task building on the other. This is fine for smaller programs, like the ones in previous posts. However, it can quickly become unwieldy if you are trying to work on larger projects. For example, say you were to write a program to make a cat meow and a dog bark. All of the code in this, written procedurally, would know about the other code. So the cat might know the .bark method, and the dog might know the .meow method. When everything knows about each other, there is a lot of room for cascading effects as you adjust one line of code.

<!--more-->

Does the dog need to know how to meow? No. It doesn't. In fact, a dog being able to meow might even break the dog all together. This is where object oriented programming becomes useful. Object oriented program is arranged as a collection of objects (a Cat object, and a Dog object, for example), rather than as a list of tasks that need to be performed. In procedural programming, all mechanics are dependent on each other. It is a collection of parts that are independently dysfunctional. Procedural programming does not support partial testing, and is difficult to make updates to the code, and nearly impossible to scale it.  In object oriented programming, however, the application is a sum of it's parts. Each individual object is testable on its own, and each object is customizable. This makes updates and scaling easy to accomplish.

Some of the core concepts of object oriented programming come down to roles, interface, and encapsulation. In Object oriented programming, each object has it's own role. This is that objects one and only job. It does not need to know about other objects or their jobs. A dog does not need to know that the .meow method exists, nor that the cat can use it. This is a separation of concerns. When things don't know about other things, there is less likelihood of something breaking. The interface is a set of known objects and methods. All objects expose a public interface to communicate with each other. Encapsulation means that objects are self-contained. Each object should be like a black box, it should not expose it's internal workings to other objects, nor should it be worried about other objects internal workings.

So, in Ruby, how does one make objects? Use objects? Write in object oriented ways? Everything in Ruby is an object. But one of the best ways to write object oriented code is by uses classes.

The way you create a class is similar to creating a method.
<blockquote>class Cat

end</blockquote>
That's it! Classes are always capitalized. Within classes you can create methods to use on the class. Classes are like blueprints. For example, you have a class Cat. You have the basic structure of a cat: it meows, it purrs, and it sleeps. But you might at some point need a cat with a louder purr, so you can take the cat class and do some separate customization on it.

When you create a class, you should always initialize it. Initializing is setting the defaults for the class, or the characteristics it will start out with.
<blockquote>class Cat
def initialize
puts "meow
end
end</blockquote>
If you would like to create a new instance (aka instatiating) of a class you can assign it to a variable and use the .new method.

nikki = Cat.new

You can also pass a class arguments and assign it private instance variables.
<blockquote>class Cat
def initialize(name, breed)
@name = name
@breed = breed
end
end</blockquote>
didi = Cat.new("Didi", "calico")

You can also assign "getter" and "setter" methods, which allow you to assign and retrieve information about a specific instance of the class.
<blockquote>class Cat
def initialize(name, breed)
@name = name
@breed = breed
end

def name   #getter
return @name
end

def name=(name)  #setter
@name = name.capitalize
end
end</blockquote>
Remember that part about customization? It's really easy to do by using sub-classes. A sub-class inherets the traits from it's parent class. You can do this by doing the following:

class Didi &lt; Cat
end

The '&lt;' means "extend." So you are extending the properties of the Cat class into the Didi class. You can then put in customized instance variables, or modify the behavior of the Cat class specifically for Didi.

		<title>Using Databases!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are trying to run an application, you will probably need to store data somewhere. A database helps you do this. If you've used a computer with Microsoft Office on it, you might have some passing familiarity with Excel. Excel is a database that has a graphical user interface, and can do some of it's own programming. You might have used it to create tables, or to balance your budget. If you want to create Rails apps, you will want to use a database that you can access in the terminal or console. Rails, by default, will run with SQLite. There are other options, such as postgresql, MongoDB, and MySQL. Each has their own pro's and con's, and each has had moments of extreme popularity that lead to shops still using them years later.

SQL - pronounced like sequel, as in the second thing in what should never have been more than one thing in the first place, stands for Structured Query Language. Learning SQL is a lot like learning a new language. This post is for people that do want to learn that new language. If you want to skip this post, check back later and I will be explaining how to totally get around learning SQL and just write out stuff directly into your app.

<!--more-->

SQL is a database that has rows and columns. You can perform CRUD on them. CRUD isn't as bad as it sounds. It stands for "Create, Read, Update, Destroy." Those are the actions you can perform in a database. You can create data, read it, update it, and destroy it.

Using ActiveRecord you can connect your database to your program, and use your terminal to CRUD your data via the database or via your program. Postgres and other databases you might use in doing Ruby programming are tabular databases, meaning it has rows and columns. Each record in that database is given a primary key that is unique.

For example, you might have a table in a datbase that looks like this:

id | name         | color
1  | gryffindor | red
2  | hufflepuff | yellow

Once you'ce installed postgres, you can open it by typing 'psql' in your command line. Once you open postgres you can view all the databases you have by using \l and connect to one using \c databasename. To exit you type \q. Each database can have multiple tables, so once you are connected to the database you can see the tables you have. This is a bit like having one excel doc with multiple sheets.

To create a database you would type (do you have your cap locks ready?) CREATE DATABASE databasename; and enter/return. Also, like CSS, ; are super important here. Once you've created it, you will connect to it using "\c databasename;" and then the command line prompt will change to reflect the database you are in. Once you are in the database, you can create all the tables you need. You create a table in roughly this format:
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE cats (
  id    SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  owner VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE,
  age   INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);</code></pre>
VARCHAR means variable characters, and the number that comes after it is the limit on those characters. NOT NULL means that it can't be left blank, UNIQUE means only one can exist in the database (good for things like emails, but, well, cats don't have emails), INTEGER is for number, and DEFAULT 0 in the above example means that if a value isn't given, it will automatically be assigned to '0'. SERIAL PRIMARY KEY means that a key will be assigned automatically in incremental increases. ALSO: NOTE THE SEMI COLON.

Now that you've created your table, you need some data in it. To add a cat to the cats table you would type

INSERT INTO cats (name, owner, age) VALUES ('Didi', 'Nikki", 4);

DO NOT FORGET THE SEMI COLON. There is nothing worse than forgetting that semicolon. Now that you have some information in your table, you need to be able to search it and select from it. If you want to see all rows you can type:

SELECT * FROM cats;

Again. Semi-colon.  To select just certain data you can specify which you want:

SELECT * FROM cats WHERE age &lt; 1;
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE owner = "Nikki";

You can combine them with the AND operator. Also. Do. Not. Forget. The. Semicolon.

If you made a typo and need to update or something's changed, you can type:

UPDATE cats SET age = 5 WHERE name="Didi";

If you need to delete a record you can type:

DELETE FROM cats WHERE name = "Didi";

But please don't actually delete Didi. She's a very good cat.

Now that we can do some simple SQL, we can get into Active Record, and, soon be able to create all this stuff without writing any SQL!

You can access the information you have in your databases via ActiveRecord. Active Record is a model, or a piece of data in Rails. Rails is like a house, with walls and floors and windows and support beams; it has many parts and they all have different functions. Active Record is like a piece of the house. It's able to function on it's own outside of it's purpose in a house, though. So it's a bit like a sink, you can use a sink or might need a sink at times when you aren't in a house.

Make sure you have the Active Record gem installed, which you should if you have Rails. Otherwise "gem install 'active_record'" in your command line. You must also require it in your Ruby file. At the top of your Ruby file, add "require 'active_record'" and you should be set! You should also make sure that you have the right adapter. An adapter is like those things you buy when you are going to other countries and need to still use electricity. Active Record can talk to any database, but it will need a different adapter for each. Figure out which database you are using and install the right adapter.

If everything is all set up, the complicated part starts now. To connect your database to Active Record you're going to need to type in:

ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection("postgres://user:password/database_name")

Very tricky, I know. Now, how do we use this to talk to a database? You do so by creating a model in your Ruby file and having it linked to ActiveRecord. Like this:

class Cat &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

Because Ruby is based on convention, it will do what people lovingly/hatingly call "Ruby Magic". It will see that there is a table called cats and assign it's contents to the Cat class.  The convention is that the table will be plural, and snake case, while the model will be capitalized and camel case. Active Record is about 99% capable of figuring out irregular plurals like wolf and wolves.

Now that you have everything hooked up you can use pry or irb console to add data, edit it, and delete it. You can run your Ruby program and use the following methods:

Model.all
Model.count
Model.find(&lt;id&gt;)
Model.destroy(&lt;id&gt;)
Model.where(:field =&gt; "value")
Model.order()

Using these methods, you can easily search your database in the console, or write methods to display your data!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I did a brief review of the Lunar Chronicles in my post about my unintentional year of not reading men. As you may recall, I'm purposefully not reading men this year. This is becoming difficult as I get more into the tech field and I want to read some "pinnacle" books. So far I've been immersing myself in Sandi Metz's Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby, and stalling on coming to a decision about cheats. In fiction, though, I've had no problems meeting my goals.

I've had "Fairest" pre-ordered on Amazon since it was announced. My friend <a title="Pairing Wine and Candy" href="http://www.uncorkedunwrapped.com" target="_blank">Liz</a> introduced me to the Lunar Chronicle books about a year ago, conveniently when "Cress" had just been released so I did not have to wait at all after finishing "Scarlet" to find out what happens next. This was a relief after my childhood was spent waiting for the next Harry Potter. And then I found out Fairest would come out next, I was both elated and dejected. I had to wait longer to find out what would become of Kai and Cinder? Unfair. A chance to find out why Levana was a royal pain and learn more of Cinder's origins and her mothers past? Yes please!

<!--more-->

Obligatory spoiler warning for small plot points you might find on the dust jacket.

I was expecting an answer to why Levana hated mirrors, why she wore her veil, why she tried, and later realized she failed at, killing her niece and how her sister died. I was expecting a story that would make her sympathetic, that would give good reasons why she did what she did. I was expecting a story about wrong deeds done for the right reasons. Why else would one write about a villain if not to add some sympathy. The trend of sympathetic villains can be recently exemplified with the extensive re-writes of Frozen and the actual final version of Malificent. Seeing as Levana is a mash up of Queen Beryl from Sailor Moon and Snow White's evil Step Mother, I was expecting to see a similar tragic story told to justify why she became the way she is.

I did find a tragic story, however, it made me hate Levana more than I already did. While her sister, Cinder's mother, was not portrayed as a saint or savior of Luna (unlike Queen Serenity) she was at least not a murderess. Levana's entire world is being the second daughter of the King and Queen of an extravagant and frivolous court. While her father may have had eyes on long term plans to invade and conquer Earth in an attempt to remedy the problem of dwindling natural lunar resources, the court is otherwise involved in the luxury of glamors and illusion. When they are murdered by 'shells' she finds herself as next in line to the thrown.

Her sister dedicates herself to quickly securing an heir to supplant Levana by means of sleeping with a number of men and keeping the father of her child a mystery. She is thus able to cultivate alliances among a number of families, each being lead to believe the heir is partially of their blood line. This bit of politiking serves a court reminiscent of Henry VIII but does not solve the problems Levana is convinced only she sees.

From the start of the story Levana has a crush on a man who is, inconveniently, married and expecting a child soon. Through a series of coincidental events, the wife dies and leaves a newborn child behind. Levana sees this as fate and uses coercion and mind control to attempt to make this man truly fall in love with her. She forces him to marry her, and he attempts to make the best of it to secure safety for his daughter. Levana adopts this child as a stepdaughter and makes her a princess. She is a playmate for the young Cinder.

Soon after, Levana's sister also coincidentally dies. While we the readers know that none of the convenient deaths til now have been Levana's orchestration, it does not phase Levana at all. I was expecting guilt at the death of her husbands first wife, I was expecting grief at the loss of her sister. Was this not supposed to be a tragic villain back story? Were these events not supposed to motivate her later tyrannical rule?

I was not a fan of the ways in which Levana attempted to manipulate and control her husband, it was uncomfortable to read. She had power over him in ways that don't include her Lunar Gift. He was a palace guard, and she was a princess. She was his employer, she was able to banish him. She had the ability to have him locked up. She reminded him of this constantly. The entire relationship is abusive and he has no escape. She was a tyrant from the start.

With her sister dead, she assumes the crown as a regent until her niece is old enough to rule on her own. Levana enjoys this power, and uses it as she thinks is best for the kingdom. She slowly realizes that as her niece grows up, her time as ruler is closer to an end. She uses her Gift to manipulate a nurse into catching her nieces room on fire, securing her step-daughter first. Her husband almost immediately sees through this, as do many others. Levana, rightfully, is convinced of a plot that might have lead to the continued survival of her niece, and orchestrates a hunt for anyone who might have had part in it. At this point in the story, this is expected. A combination of us, the readers, knowing Cinder is alive and well and exactly how she escaped, and also the fact that so far every decision of Levana's reveals her cruelty to us, makes this plot point obvious.

The only thing I was left wondering was, if the first book starts with Levana wanting to marry Kai, what happened to her husband? She might not love him, but she certain is possessive of him. The one surprise in this book was the way in which she meticulously planned his death, and that it was so she could be free to make a more political marriage.

Overall, I enjoyed the book. I was glad it wasn't a sympathetic re-telling of Queen Beryl/Evil Queen from Snow White.  We've had a lot of those recently. It wasn't as good, in my opinion, as <em>Cinder</em> and I am really wanting to know the conclusion to the story. If you are recommending these books to someone, I suggest a <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> treatment, read this one first.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alcestis was recommended to me at the beginning of the year. I eagerly bought it and put it in my to-read pile. I got about 10% into it and just didn't see where it was going. I put it down for a bit to try something else. Yesterday I decided "No, I have to finish this." I have a whole list of books I want to read and review this year, and my complacency in continuing to plough through re-reads was not acceptable.

So I picked it up late one night  when I went to bed. I put it down at 2 AM that night to sleep, then woke up at 8 AM and finished it. The slow first few chapters picked up quickly, and didn't let up until the abrupt end. While the pacing seems off from start to finish, the story it tells is worth it.

<!--more-->

<strong>The Perfect Woman, The Ideal Wife</strong>

Alcestis is portrayed in Greek mythology as the perfect wife of Admetus. She loved her husband so fully and wholely that when Hermes came to take him to the Underworld, Alcestis volunteered to go in his place. She never spoke out of turn, she never raised her eyes higher than decorum allowed. She was an ideal woman who knew her place and never sought to leave it. After three days in the Underworld Heracles makes his way there, battles Death, and rescues her. She is returned to her husband and provides him children.  She was the damsel in distress, she was worthy of a heroic rescue. She came back and resumed her role as wife, taking her duty to provide offspring seriously.

The re-telling paints Alcestis as greif-striken by the loss of her favorite sister. She does not desire anything more than a husband who is not like her father. She is well mannered because that is how she avoids her fathers temper. When she decides to take her husband's place, it is not because she loves him, but because she knows if he dies, he is shamed and she has no where to go. If someone else goes, he is shamed, and she has to live with that. She does not see anyway in which the situation will resolve with her maintaining her dignity, as her dignity is so closely tied to her husbands. Her choice comes down to living in shame or dying with dignity. If she goes, she avoids the shame and stigma of having a coward for a husband, and can find her sister.

<strong>That Pesky Thing Where Women Have Agency</strong>

Alcestis exerts agency over this situation by making the choice that she feels is best for her, not what is best for her husband. She might care for her husband, but this retelling presents it more as (ironically) self-preservation than a total devotion to her husband's life. However, as this book comes back to again and again, every time a woman exerts agency in her own life, it is mistaken for something else, or it is ignored entirely. Her agency is re-written by the men in the story as love for her husband.

This entire book is about women's agency being striped from them and replaced with male wishes. In the Underworld, Alcestis meets, and falls in love with, Persephone. She learns that Persephone maybe wasn't raped by Hades. Persephone tells her story of meeting Hades, and tells how others percieved her meeting of Hades. This plot line makes it clear that to the rest of the world, Persephone couldn't possibly have made her own choices. While the rest of the world cannot concieve of a world where Persephone willingly ate the fruit and decided to stay in the Underworld. She obviously was tricked, or was too ignorant to know what she was doing. The world re-writes her story to fit into their boxes of what women are and how women operate.

This is reinforced in Alcestis's talk with her grandmother, who had children with Poseidon. Her grandmother, Tyro, is vague about the consent that may or may not have happened. Was it a love story or was it a rape? When Alcestis is confronted with her own desire for Persephone, she knows it is a choice she made. She cannot tell anyone she was tricked by Persephone, or lured in, or gone mad with grief from being seperated from her husband. She cannot pretend she was somehow bewitched. She realized she had acted with agency and intent. However, when Heracles comes to "rescue" her, she realizes that his narrative is always going to be the one that matters. There is no other way this can play out, except as him rescuing her from the spell of Persephone. The fact that the truth is something different does not matter to him, it is impossible for him to see the truth. He witnesses the truth of it, but quickly explains, to himself and to Alcestis, what he <em>wishes </em>were really going on. And since he is a hero, and this is supposed to be his story, his wish is reality.

It is impossible for men in this story to conceive of women having agency.  Alcestis realizes that if a woman consensually has sex with someone, and another man takes issue with that, and thinks of this woman as his property, than it is rape. It is not the consent that is important, it is if some other man has claimed the woman in question. A woman's agency in the matter is not important.

<strong>Everyone Is Bisexual, Possibly Poly?
</strong>

Well, not everyone. But enough people to make me incredibly happy about the amount of sexual fluidity. There was so much representation of people just loving/liking/lusting people because they are people, and not because of what they think is in their pants. The relationships between people who were liking/loving/lusting were real relationships, with real flaws, hang-ups, complications and all the messy stuff that goes with lusting. The relationship that was Apollo-Admetus-Alcestis was almost touching in a way. I don't know if was meant to be an intentional representation of how a poly relationship might function, but it felt like one to me. It was domestic, but it was complicated. There was so much unspoken between the three of them. Likewise, the Alcestis-Persephone-Hades relationship felt like a foil, or maybe a compliment to the previously mentioned relationship. It was messy, and really fucked up in a lot of ways, but it was people being completely aware of their partners other parter and not trying to take away from that. At no point did Alcestis try to stop Admetus and Apollo, and Hades didn't try to stop Persephone and Alcestis. The relationships weren't <em>healthy </em>all the time, but they were real. Not once was the sexual fluidity of Admetus or Persephone or Alcestis remarked on as being bad for being sometimes homosexual, Heracles didn't scold Alcestis for being queer, but for not being a wholely devoted wife.

My only qualm with this book would be the pacing. It started slowly, then suddenly picked up speed only to quickly come to a screeching halt of a stop at the end. I wanted, for the first time in my life, an epilogue showing Alcestis's daughter. I wanted to know if she was ever able to get over Persephone, if she waited each spring. I wanted more of a conclusion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Disclosure: I attended college with the author of this book.</em>

"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SVWX5TM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00SVWX5TM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nikkmurr-20&amp;linkId=5PTEVH5ZVSSDMKCG" target="_blank">Second Position</a>" came out about a month ago, but sat in my "to-read" pile for a bit due to that hell known as 'moving' happening. I was finally able to get around to it, and am really glad I did. Before I go further, though. I must make appropriate trigger warnings for the book itself. It discusses recovery for alcohol addiction, and recovery from an eating disorder. I had to put this book down several times, as I am in recovery for an eating disorder and it would get triggering.

The book is part of what people are calling the "New Adult" genre, for those of us who loved YA books, but are now finding ourselves less and less in the heroines and heroes as we battle student debt, the first job, and the dissolution of those high school and college romances. What happens when you realize George Cooper, dashing and 17 in the first book, is getting younger and younger?

"Second Postion" is a book about growing up, about dealing with change in other people and change in yourself.  Aly and Zed, the main characters, suffered a traumatic car accident four years to the start of the book. This accident has left them both scarred. The careers they had in dancing seemed so sure, so strong and reliable until that car crash. Now they must face the demon's they've been avoiding.

This is definitely a character-driven novel. The tension in the story comes from within both Aly and Zed, and between them. They are both their own worst enemy, and the others.  This book is about them overcoming their shared and individual trauma's and trying to fit back into the way things were.

The prose was like music, slow, then a crescendo, finally staccato. Then the coda and it repeats again. At points it wasn't clear if it was a poem or prose or both. There was a lot of mileage in the homophones of "barre" and "bar". and the comparing of addictions.

I did not read "Turning Pointe" before reading this novel, and I did not feel as though I'd missed out on anything. The back story was done justice throughout the novel. Enough details given to give the sketch, and the rest given to fill in the details as the story went on.

Because I'd seen the author worry over this: It does pass the Bechtel Test at least twice by my count. Once, when Aly and her mother go to the store, and once when Aly and a student discuss dance technique. With that said, this is primarily a romance, and almost all of the dialogue and interactions are between Aly and Zed.

Overall I would recommend this book if you are in a good place to read a tale of tragedy and hope and romance. It's not, in my opinion, the lighthearted beach read of the summer. Maybe the reflective camping-trip read of the autumn, though.

		<title>Dell XPS 13 Developers Edition 2015 and Ubuntu Machines</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You may have read my post on not needing expensive Mac's to do development on (if not, <a href="http://www.nikkilizmurray.com/everyone-has-macs-and-those-are-expensive-do-i-need-a-mac/">please do!</a>). Since that post I have done some digging on finding good Ubuntu machine's. I wanted to get a bit of an upgrade, and I didn't want to mess around with drivers for hours converting a window's machine. I hear there's ways to put Ubuntu on Mac's, too. But, really, I hate Yosemite. It's awful to develop on and it's just not fun to have in general in my opinion.

If you don't mind larger laptops,<a href="https://system76.com/laptops/galago?utm_source=google_search&amp;utm_medium=cpc_text&amp;utm_term=ubuntu-laptop&amp;utm_content=ubuntu-laptop_galu1-sleek.txt&amp;utm_campaign=keyword" target="_blank"> System 76</a> might have a machine for you. They specialize in creating laptops to run Linux on them. The most affordable is currently around $600. However, if you are looking for something Macbook Air sized, you aren't going to find it there right now. You could try <a href="http://zareason.com/shop/Laptops/" target="_blank">ZaReason</a>, too.  They let you pick the Linux distro that it ships with. However, even their thinnest and lightest is not in the same range as MacBook Air's. If you have an incredible amount of money to put toward a Linux laptop, you could go with <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/purism/librem-15" target="_blank">Librem</a> (which is built to have the least amount of proprietary software on it as possible, a goal I totally support but cannot afford).

The laptop I ended up purchasing is the newest of <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/xps-13-linux/pd?oc=&amp;model_id=xps-13-linux&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd" target="_blank">Dell's XPS</a> line. It is part of their "Project Sputnik" initiative to ship working laptops with Ubuntu on them. I'd read a review about the previous Developers Edition, and was really intrigued by the reviewer saying "<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/it-just-works-dell-xps-13-developer-edition-linux-ultrabook-review/" target="_blank">it just works</a>." That's a pretty big phrase for anyone trying to make a Linux life. I first purchased a system with Linux on it from Dell in 2009. It was a small netbook with 10.04 LTS on it. I didn't know anything about Ubuntu except that I could get it on my netbook for free, whereas I needed to pay $100 more to have Window's on it. I learned my way around apt and the dangers of sudo the hard way: trial and error. At the end of that, I had a healthy respect for Dell's ability to produce an Ubuntu certified machine. I <em>wouldn't</em> have said "it just works," though.

After my experience hacking a Chromebook to run Ubuntu, I wanted to give Dell another shot at it. The newest XPS had just been released, so I eagerly bought it. Due to some parts shortages, it took about three weeks from ordering to arrive. I must say, there was very little communication from Dell about what was going on and why the shipping was taking awhile. There was a lot of miscommunication among the customer service team, and a lot of incorrect information given to me during this time.

The XPS arrived at last, and I've been using it quiet a bit. It is thin, thinner by far than any other laptop I looked at, and thinner than my Chromebook. It's lightweight, and it's about the same size as an 11" Macbook Air, not as light though. The positives so far: it runs Ubuntu well. I can fit (so far) my preferred text editors and IDE's on it (RubyMine and Sublime Text). It's keyboard is backlit. The screen is matte. I like the lightweight and I like the thinness a lot. The battery life is not amazing, but it's not awful. I would say around 9 hours of moderate to heavy use.  The neutrals: The camera is in the bottom left corner, making video calls awkward. I suppose this was done to keep the bevel as small as possible, but it is really distracting to the other person I am talking to, not to mention they can see me typing. I don't use this for work video calls. The negatives: The trackpad. The trackpad issue is predictable since it's Linux and trackpads. But it's really annoying and I worked a way to fix it, but it caused my wireless to cease working. 

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I hope Dell learns to not put a camera in the corner ever again, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. I am going to keep fiddling with the trackpad and hope to find a solution soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Review: Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler</title>
		<link>http://www.nikkilizmurray.com/review-parable-of-the-sower-by-octavia-butler/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I decided to pick up Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler after I was recommended it by several people, and I am really glad I did. I know dystopian is all the rage now, but let me tell you, Butler had this genre down long before Katniss was even thought of. While the events of The Hunger Games seem unlikely, people recognize that some part of human nature could allow that to happen, and to continue. Butler, though, shows an all too real and all too likely future dystopia. 

Her dystopia has all the hallmarks of ages gone by, those days we shudder and sigh about, saying "we didn't know better." Debt slavery, the buying and selling of children for labor, a government quickly selling off public assets to private companies and those companies making life hell for the public. 

The story centers on a young black woman with a strange birth defect (the ability to feel others pain, said to be the result of her mothers drug addiction) growing up in what was a solid middle class neighborhood and is now struggling to get by. The neighborhood has a wall around it to keep the poor out. Notably, it is a neighborhood in denial about how bad things are getting, and how close to being poor they themselves are. Lauren is not so naive. She sees the poor people beyond the wall as the inevitable future. She knows that one day people will be so angry at their situation, and see the 'wealth' that is their neighborhood, and try to attack. Her father, a preacher, knows this too and tries to get their neighbors on the right track to be able to survive.

Lauren's tactics are different than her fathers. So different that she forms an entirely new religion called Earthseed, the destiny of which is to spread across the stars. Lauren's belief system is about change and it's inevitability, it is about learning how to adapt to change, and learning how to use that change to one's advantage. 

The book is highly relatable, as Lauren grows up and sees a very bleak feature in their gated community. Getting a job is incredibly hard, and while both her parents have jobs, and the neighbors all own their houses, her generation cannot hope for so much. The most they can hope for is to get married and have their own room in their parents house. Lauren wants something bigger, but the current state of the country doesn't seem hospitable to her dreams.

The attack she fears finally does come, and she and two peers are the only known survivors. They head north, and along the way find more desperate people. A family, former debt slaves, a doctor, and more people who are looking for something better. Each person meaningfully challenges Lauren's ideals and beliefs. 

This is a fantastic book that I highly recommend. Read this book if you want to add diversity to your reading list, if you want to read about humanity at it's worst, and see it at it's best. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Review: Fox-Hat and Neko by August Li</title>
		<link>http://www.nikkilizmurray.com/review-fox-hat-and-neko-by-august-li/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was provided a copy of this book to review by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

Fox-Hat and Neko, by August Li, follows the tale of a "chosen one" born in Japan, and his journey from accepting his special powers to the final defeat of the antagonist. Along the way he befriends a fox spirit, a cat demon, a cheerful artist, a determined archer, an impoverished baker, a heartbroken antique dealer, and a enthusiastic English teacher. 

Not everyone is as they seem, and many of his acquaintances have secrets they would prefer to keep. 

The book is interspersed with manga-esque black and white sketches, and the book takes on the feel of a manga in some capacity. While a lot of the book takes place in Japan, due to the nature of Ayumu Tsunkino's power to walk in an manipulate dreams, the book also takes on a dream like feel. The reader could easily become lost in these dream sequences, where the action can jump and characters can randomly be somewhere else. 

It is in these dream chapters that a lot of the character development happens, as people's darkest fears are exposed in a nightmare sequence. The artist, Chou, fears being trapped in a dull office job; Ikehara, the baker, feels trapped by his younger siblings and his obligations to his family. 

I feel it prudent to point out that many of the characters are somewhere along the spectrum of queer sexuality. There is no push-back from any of their friends or family about this. This novel did not address homophobia and what LGBT teens might go through in terms of bullying or parental anger. None of the characters experienced any trauma for being queer, specifically. This was incredibly refreshing. There was one short conversation where a lesbian expressed fear to her bisexual girlfriend over losing her to a boy. Her girlfriend very firmly pointed out how awful that was, and why it was unfair. The lesbian listened, believed her, and apologized. Again, incredibly refreshing to see the stigma of bisexuality addressed and have a character apologize for engaging in it. As a queer woman, I already know what homophobia is, I experience it every day. I don't need to be shown it in fiction, too. My experiences aren't a plot device.

Another thing about this book that made me happy was it very briefly addressed polyamory. It might have been unintentional, but a character expresses a sentiment that she loves two people at the same time and wants them both. While this isn't acted on, I felt it appropriately handled how poly feels. 

Despite the amazingness that was good representation that let queer characters stand as their own people, this book was at times slow. There was a lot of telling in place of showing, and due to the dream-like nature of the battles, it became hard to follow at times. There were a few false-starts with figuring out who the Big Bad was, and it took, in my opinion, an incredibly long time for all of the back story to be fleshed out. It was teased for a long time, and it felt really drawn out. 

Overall, pick this up if you want to read thoughtful representations without all the homophobia laid bare. Also, maybe read this if you want to hear about Usagi Tsukino's cousin? I don't know about that, but it's really all I could think about. Maybe don't buy this if you are looking for either queer tragedy porn or don't like queer people? ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I received a copy of Slaying Dragons by Sasha L. Miller from NetGalley and Less Than Three Press in exchange for an honest review.

Slaying Dragons is a novella of about 28,000 words, and each one of those words lingers. For a small story, there is a lot of world building done. The unnamed location is plagued by dragons, basilisks, wyrms, and other fantastic monsters. An organization comprised of mages and knights exists to eliminate these threats. Mages and combatants are paired temporarily to take on an assignment to kill one of these beasts, and then they receive new orders usually with a new partner. 

Devi, a strong woman with years of training, has not had so much luck in this department lately. After a series of bad partners lands her in hot water, she is surprised she has a new assignment but hopeful that the new partner won't be as terrible as the noble who wanted the glory of being a battle mage without the work. Noeme, the mage, seems knowledgeable even if she's never battled a dragon. Devi is cautiously hopeful.

As a reader, I was instantly rooting for Noeme and Devi. The attraction between the two was palpable and a pleasure to read. However, the will-they/won't-they never detracted from the action of their dragon-slaying assignment. Likewise, the dragon-slaying action enhanced the will-they/won't-they in a way that never felt contrived.

Also, the ending was perfect and amazing and everything I ever could have asked for in an amazing novella of two cool ladies slaying dragons.

The pacing felt slightly off, as I expected the climax to be the dragon-slaying, but, spoilers. Once I figured this out, (and once Devi does, too), everything else seemed to fall into place, and the pacing seemed obvious. As this was an ARC, there were a few errors I noticed (at one point, near the end, Devi is referred to as a mage, when she's very  clearly not!) which I hope will be corrected for publication.

Overall, read this if you want a fun short story of ladies killing dragons. Don't read this if you don't think ladies can kill dragons.]]></content:encoded>
