    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Big news! I am publishing a short story as a Kindle Select ebook! It is titled &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MS9NU7F/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1484938920&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The Resignation Letter&lt;/a&gt;, a fantasy story about class, war, love, magic, and tough choices. You can add it to your TBR on &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33955963-the-resignation-letter?from_search=true"&gt;goodreads&lt;/a&gt;. I've been working on this short story for awhile, and would like to thank &lt;a href="http://www.kathowardbooks.com/"&gt;Kat Howard&lt;/a&gt; for her editing on some of my initial drafts, and &lt;a href="https://juneberrydesign.myportfolio.com/"&gt;Louisa of Juneberry Designs&lt;/a&gt; for the fantastic cover. I'd also like to thank my paramours for their support, and for encouraging me with squees as they read drafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is hopefully the first of many queer short stories that I plan on publishing in ebook format. For now, you can pre-order the book on Amazon. (Please note the placeholder cover should be gone soon, and the fabulous cover should take it's place!) The long and the short of the story is queer in a fantasy setting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more technical note, you may have noticed I haven't reviewed a book here in awhile. I was busy working as a software engineer at the Democratic National Committee, which was a really intense job with really long hours! While I had some time to read here and there, it wasn't as much as I usually have, so no time to review.  I hope to maybe do some back-log reviewing in the coming weeks. Also, I may still blog here about code occassionally, but most of my coding stuffy is being moved to &lt;a href="http://dax.codes"&gt;dax.codes&lt;/a&gt;, so here should be mostly feminism and books. You can also find more of my cats now at &lt;a href="http://dax.cat"&gt;dax.cat&lt;/a&gt;. MY CATS ARE WEBSCALE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last detail: I came out as genderqueer, and I am in the process of changing my name. I go by Dax now, you might find some references throughout this site to my old name still, or links to accounts of mine I still haven't changed to reflect my new name. Changing names is a lot of work and a lot of time. Forgive these brief discrepencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solidarity!&lt;br /&gt;
Dax&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Review: The Insurrectionist and the Empress Who Reigns Over Time by Benjanun Sriduangkaew</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This short story is available for free on Beneath the Ceaseless Sky's website. You can also pay for it on Amazon so you can read it on your Kindle. I did the latter because 1.) It's so good you should support it financially and 2.) I prefer e-ink to backlit screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Insurrectionist and the Empress Who Reigns Over Time" was written specifically to show you can have bad things happen to people, but not make it about the bad things happening because the characters are queer. There is a pattern in fiction, television, movies, where many queer people are shown as so good and pure, by virtue of being queer, that bad things must happen to them to show how cruely the world treats them. They are "too good for this sinful earth" or the authorial intent is to showcase how bad homophobia, biphobia and transphobia are. For me, and others, fiction is an escape from this world. Benjanun Sriduangkaew tweeted out that she intended to show that the bad acts that happen to characters can happen for reasons that are not tied to their sexuality or gender, and that those same characters can also have happy endings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that "Insurrectionist" accomplished this goal. Benjanun Sriduangkaew did an excellent job of creating a world that felt huge, but not giving the reader the long, rambling history of the world, all of its people, and what the cook makes at every meal. True, this is a short story, so that is the goal. But all of the characters felt real, and while you might not know what happened in some distant past to make them the way they are today, you had enough context to know that their behavior was not arbitrary, and based on plot necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Insurrectionist" is the story of a woman who leads uprisings against current governments by working to make rebellions look natural, she uses words and speeches to change the opinions of people. Her greatest gift is her ability to bend words. One day, however, her luck runs out. She is captured, her mouth sewn shut, and imprisoned by an Empress from a kingdom near the one she'd just conquered. The Empress, as the  reader may have guessed, has her own unique abilities. She can move time, and wishes to change a key event. As the Insurrectionist and the Empress figure out how they might be useful to each other, they also figure out they are also attracted to each other. At the end, they find a solution that satisfyingly resolves both of their inner conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This short story is not just noteworthy for having two women who are attracted to women as the main characters. The Empress has two mothers, one assumes from the terms that her one mothers is a trans woman, and the other a cis woman. It was incredibly normal to all of the characters involved. Of course the Empress had a giving-mother, and a bearing-mother. Of course that is a normal family structure. It's also evident that the Empress's current situation, her current emotions and thoughts, are not the result of bad parenting or the result of having a unique-to-the-reader family structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I believe this is the best short story I've read so far in 2015. The writing is beautiful, some beautiful child of poetry and prose. The pacing is perfect for a story about displacement in time, and the pacing served to further that sense of displacement that the Insurrectionist feels. The characters were real and experienced loss and tragedy in the their lives, but never was that loss inextricably tied to their sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read this short story if you are a human with a soul. Don't read this short story if you are a a huge transphobe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received an ARC copy of 'Witches and Wolves' from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Witches and Wolves' was a fun novella about learning to be yourself and falling in love. The story focuses on Tory, a witch who lives in the wood to get away from the city life; Tory's ex-boyfriend, a werewolf who also enjoys the seclusion of the woods; and Gee, a young woman who is new to being a werewolf. Gee is just learning how to control her wolf, and finds herself on Tory's doorstep one night. With the help of her new friends, she learns how to embrace who she is, and also finds herself falling for Tory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this story was well paced, and the contrast between the external conflicts and the internal conflicts worked to highlight and enhance the inner struggles Gee was going through. I also appreciated that the potential love triangles were not those of most fiction today, and the bisexuality of Tory was not a point of contention for anyone. It's really refreshing to have a bisexual character who is allowed to be human, and isn't subjected to doubt or mistrust from any potential, new, or former lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the world-building, too. I felt there was enough details to get a sense of the world without being bogged down in unnecessary backstory or long pages of history. I got enough backstory for the world to know what was relavant to the plot, and a few additional tidbits to make the world of witches, werewolves, and werewolf hunters seem real, interesting, and detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through and through, this was a romance story. There was a side plot to solidify the relationship between Gee and Tory, and I enjoyed it. My criticisms would be the length, as I thought it was a bit too short. I would have liked to have a few more intimate scenes between the two of them (not intimate in terms of sexy times, but a few more touching moments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read this book if you like werewolves and witches falling in love. Don't read this book if you are a fan of the "Bury your gays" trope, and "bisexuals don't exist" tropes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received a free copy of "Witch, Cat, and Cobb" from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Witch, Cat, and Cob is set in a fantasy world of elves and kingdoms which seems rather ordinarily heterosexual, with marriages of that type being the norm, but there is mention of the occasional marriage between people of the same sex. The story starts off with a Princess very determined to not end up in a heterosexual marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learn very early on that there are many secrets being kept among the cast of characters, and that some of those secrets involve mysterious events from before the Princess was born. She finds herself in the center of a conflict between her cat, whom she finds out is not a regular cat, and a beautiful witch who lives in the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As each character confronts their past, and what they are running away from, they realize that they have responsibilities to more than just their own self-interest. All of the characters went through growth and development, and the ending felt as though all of the characters were at a satisfying conclusion to their growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing of the story was a little rocky at the start, I felt that the introduction was rather abrupt, with not enough context given at first. The introduction of all the characters seemed a little rushed, and I wish I could have had a little more time to get to know each character on their own at the start. Likewise, the ending, while satisfying, left me wanting more in a way that didn't feel good. It felt rushed, and I wanted to linger in those moments a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room is the diversity in this book. If you do not want spoilers, please read no further. Otherwise, I felt this story handled queer representation really well. The way magic is used to handle transitions and the acceptance of those people as people and worthy of love was admirable. This is a story that speaks to me on a lot of levels, but the recognition of a cis woman and a trans woman in a relationship with each other was beautiful and respectful. I appreciated that there was no gratutitous tragedy involved for the sake of tragedy. Everyone got their happy ending, and nothing bad happened to the characters just because they were queer in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, read this if you want a happy fantasy story about queer characters! Don't read this if you hate happy endings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Review: Slaying Dragons by Sasha L. Miller</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received a copy of Slaying Dragons by Sasha L. Miller from NetGalley and Less Than Three Press in exchange for an honest review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaying Dragons is a novella of about 28,000 words, and each one of those words lingers. For a small story, there is a lot of world building done. The unnamed location is plagued by dragons, basilisks, wyrms, and other fantastic monsters. An organization comprised of mages and knights exists to eliminate these threats. Mages and combatants are paired temporarily to take on an assignment to kill one of these beasts, and then they receive new orders usually with a new partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devi, a strong woman with years of training, has not had so much luck in this department lately. After a series of bad partners lands her in hot water, she is surprised she has a new assignment but hopeful that the new partner won’t be as terrible as the noble who wanted the glory of being a battle mage without the work. Noeme, the mage, seems knowledgeable even if she’s never battled a dragon. Devi is cautiously hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reader, I was instantly rooting for Noeme and Devi. The attraction between the two was palpable and a pleasure to read. However, the will-they/won’t-they never detracted from the action of their dragon-slaying assignment. Likewise, the dragon-slaying action enhanced the will-they/won’t-they in a way that never felt contrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the ending was perfect and amazing and everything I ever could have asked for in an amazing novella of two cool ladies slaying dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing felt slightly off, as I expected the climax to be the dragon-slaying, but, spoilers. Once I figured this out, (and once Devi does, too), everything else seemed to fall into place, and the pacing seemed obvious. As this was an ARC, there were a few errors I noticed (at one point, near the end, Devi is referred to as a mage, when she’s very clearly not!) which I hope will be corrected for publication. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.lessthanthreepress.com/books/index.php?main_page=product_bookx_info&amp;amp;cPath=92&amp;amp;products_id=954"&gt;Less Than Three press to pre-order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, read this if you want a fun short story of ladies killing dragons. Don’t read this if you don’t think ladies can kill dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
