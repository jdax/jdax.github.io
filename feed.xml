    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's here! Louisa of &lt;a href="https://juneberrydesign.myportfolio.com/"&gt;Juneberry Designs&lt;/a&gt; has finished the cover of &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2v1opfg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Lake of Feathers and Moonbeams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it looks &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;. I could not be happier! The novella itself has been written, and it clocked in at 52,009 words. About 7,000 more words than I wanted it to be. I did a lot of editing to get it back down to 45,117 words. Some of the cuts were hard to make but ultimately I knew the scenes I cut were slowing down the pacing. They were cute scenes! Maybe I will release them uneditted here or in a newletter one day (I would have to make a newsletter) but for now they are sitting in a folder collecting dust. I sent the editted novel to Jen of &lt;a href="http://www.clearingblocksediting.com/"&gt;Clearing Blocks Editing&lt;/a&gt; to do some more edits! If you have not yet noticed from the link at the top, it is available for pre-order! It should be hitting your kindles at the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've learned a ton since I first got Melusina in February, and I've been working on a more comprehensive guide based on my experience and my research. I am working on making a dedicated site for my snake ramblings, but for now I am gonna post a ton of good information here while still trying to get Jekyll to play nice with PureCSS's grid system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ball pythons are a very shy snake, and while they are beautiful and docile, even the tiniest bit of stress can send them down the road of a hunger strike. They will 'go off feed' for months at a time (it has happened to me!) and you can triple check and quadrupal check your husbandry and still be baffled as to why your snake isn't eating. To a beginner, this can be escpecially firghtening. Here I have outlined some of the basics of keeping  ball python along with product recommendations. Most of these will be from Amazon, but some of them will be from reptile specific companies. I recommend that you purchase everything you will need at least two weeks before you bring the actual snake home with you, so that you can get everything set up and make adjustments if you have to. When I got my boa, I had his home set up a week before hand and that allowed me to observe humidity, temps, and make small adjustments before he arrived!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Humidity&lt;/em&gt;
A ball python needs at the minimum 60% humidity. This is incredibly difficult to achieve in a glass tank with a screen top. A tub or PVC enclosure makes this super easy as there is less airflow. Humidity should be measured on the ground with a digital hygrometer. The stick on humidity gauges that pet stores hawk are often inaccurate and can cause &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/snakes/comments/6f1zjy/snake_injured_by_humidifier_gauge/"&gt;serious injury&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/snakes/comments/55qtgm/update_2_tiamat_the_snake_stuck_to_adhesive_has/"&gt;even death&lt;/a&gt; if they come unstuck from the wall and stick to your snake. I use &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2fcsrMB"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; two in one hygrometer / thermometer. I use a dab of hot glue to affix the probe to the center of the warm side of the enclosure, and keep the unit itself on the cool side. This way the "outdoor" temp shows my warm side, and the "indoor temp" shows the cool side/ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Temperature&lt;/em&gt;
Ball pythons need a thermo-gradiant w one "warm" end  between 88F and 90F and a "cool" end of 78Fish - the ambient temperature should never be below 75F, &amp;amp; should be around high 70's. In a tub or a PVC enclosure, you will want an under tank heater - heat tap, heat mats, heat pads. I recommend the flexwatt that you can get with the Animal Plastics enclosure or the &lt;a href="http://www.reptilebasics.com/ultratherm-heat-pads"&gt;ultratherm from Reptile Basics&lt;/a&gt;. If you have trouble keeping the ambient up in the PVC enclosure, you may want to get a &lt;a href="http://www.reptilebasics.com/rbi-radiant-heat-panels"&gt;radiant heat panel&lt;/a&gt;, which installs to the ceiling of the enclosure. For a glass tank, you will probably need a ceramic heat emitter installed over the cage to keep ambient temperatures appropriate. CHE sucks out humidity, so you will need to be extra on top of that. CHE gives off no visible light. Red lights are often given out like candy at PetCo/Smart places as good ways to provide heat at night. They are not. Ball pythons can see red light, and it messes up their day/night cycle.  You will also want an &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2vnG41U"&gt;IR thermometer gun&lt;/a&gt;. This is good for spot checking temperatures without moving around probes &amp;amp; also checking the temps of the prey items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thermostats&lt;/em&gt;
Any &amp;amp; all heat sources you have for your ball python need to be controlled by a thermostat. Failure to appropriately control your heat source can lead to it quickly becoming 120F and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/snakes/comments/6ihxu8/need_help_with_my_ball_python_belly_is_hurt_and/"&gt;injuring your snake&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend &lt;a href="http://www.spyderrobotics.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=1&amp;amp;products_id=25"&gt;Spyder Robotics Herpstats&lt;/a&gt;. You can get larger ones w more probes so that you can control all your heat sources w one unit. They have a ton of good safety features.. The cheaper ones are around $100ish. If that is too much for you, there are a lot of people who use the &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2wcbMg5"&gt;Jumpstart&lt;/a&gt; thermostats, but they have less safety features &amp;amp; can wear out quickly. They also make a loud clicking sound periodically. I cannot stress this enough, this is not a place to cut corners. You need a thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PVC Enclosure I have has cut outs on the bottom of the enclosure to put thermostat probes. I have the probe in that slot, and the under tank heater taped with aluminum tape to the outside bottom. The heat goes through the plastic and heats the floor of the enclosure. I have the thermostat set to 98F, and that puts the floor temperature of the enclosure at 90F. Even though I have the thermostat, I also always check the thermometer I have affixed to the inside floor to make sure the thermostat is working. For Radient Heat Panels, you wil want to dangle the probe next to the RHP. The RHP will be screwed to the ceiling, and you then dril a hole to dangle the probe through or drill a hole on the side to slide it in and then affix it to the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enclosure&lt;/em&gt;
Glass tanks with screen lids are very bad for ball pythons. Glass tanks are bad at keeping heat in, and the screen lid is bad at keeping humidity in. For a cheap but effective route, you could look at getting a tub set up (using a rubber maid/sterilite /iris tub &amp;amp; soldering or drilling holes into the sides - here is a&lt;a href="https://ball-pythons.net/forums/showthread.php?113879-My-Plastic-Tub-Setup-for-my-Ball-Python"&gt; good tutorial of setting that up&lt;/a&gt; ). I highly recommend the &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2fcVgsk"&gt;Iris Weathertight&lt;/a&gt;, it has plenty of clips on the edge for security. If you choose another type, without these locking clamps, you should also look at luggage straps for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is a PVC enclosure. I have an &lt;a href="http://www.apcages.com/home/"&gt;Animal Plastics&lt;/a&gt; T8 for my ball python. It has sliding glass doors, I installed LED's myself, and I got it with the flexwatt under tank heater. It came unassembled, but with clear directions, I was able to build it and install my LED lighting in a single evening.  Another reputable maker of PVC cages is &lt;a href="http://www.boaphileplastics.com/"&gt;Boaphile&lt;/a&gt;, I have not had direct experience with them, but their cages come pre-assembled, and you can ask for the lighting and heating to already be set up. For my Animal Plastics cage, it did take about five weeks for it to show up. If you want to go this route, plan way ahead. The tub route is cheaper, but takes more DIY skills. The PVC cage route is more expensive, but very aesthetically pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is absolutely no way around having a glass tank, you can cover three sides of it in foam board (ball pythons hate being exposed) to give them more security, and to help keep some heat in. You can also cover about 3/4ths of the screen lid in saran wrap to help keep humidity in. Using a substrate like coconut husk can also help with humidity. You may still end up having to mist the tank a few times a day, and you may have to keep the temperature of the room the tank is in higher to help out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what type of enclosure you get, it should be kept in a room with minimal sound and activity. Keeping it in a busy living room will result in a stressed ball python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hides&lt;/em&gt;
You want at least two similar, enclosed hides. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoo-Med-Habba-Extra-Large/dp/B0010ONMV4/"&gt;Half logs&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; suitable, they are too open &amp;amp; they stress out the BP, as they can't watch both ends at once for a predator. Some of the best hides are &lt;a href="http://www.reptilebasics.com/hide-boxes"&gt;these ones from Reptile Basics&lt;/a&gt;. They are enclosed on all sides with just a small entrance. They are dishwasher safe &amp;amp; also very cheap. If you want a more naturalistic looking hide, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2v43Ptj"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; are suitable as they are enclosed on all sides and have only one entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want them to be similar if not identical, so that the snake does not have to choose between feeling safe &amp;amp; thermoregulating. You will want one on each side of the temperature gradient. Feel free to add more that are different for diversity in the enclosure. I also have some &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2fckrLk"&gt;fake vines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2vnM6zy"&gt;leaves&lt;/a&gt; in mine so that she feels more invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water dish&lt;/em&gt;
You will want a water bowl that is large enough for the ball python to soak in. This should be changed daily, as they like to poop &amp;amp; pee in their water. You'll want something sturdy as they like to tip them over. I got some &lt;a href="http://www.reptilebasics.com/water-bowls"&gt;crock dishes from Reptile Basics&lt;/a&gt;. You don't need any water treatment for the snakes water unless you treat water for yourself. If you tap is safe for human consumption, it's safe for your snake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feeding&lt;/em&gt;
Ball pythons eat every 5 - 7 days as hatchlings and yearlings, as adults they can go longer. Ball pythons are NOTORIOUSLY picky eaters. The ideal for a ball python is a proper sized rat fed either pre-killed or frozen/thawed. I feed frozen/thawed rats from &lt;a href="http://www.perfectprey.com/frozen-rats/"&gt;Perfect Prey&lt;/a&gt;. Just a heads up - they ship with fiber glass insulation &amp;amp; dry ice. I try to open the packages outside so my cats don't get into it. They come in freezer bags and I just store them in my regular freezer. If even one thing is wrong in your husbandry, your ball python will likely not eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Much To Feed&lt;/em&gt;
The feeding amount depends on the weight of the ball python. You will want a &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2v4omOf"&gt;digital kitchen scale&lt;/a&gt;. While under 750g, you want to feed about 10%-15% of their body weight about every 7 days. Once they are in their second year you want to feed  7%-10% of their body weight, after they are in their third year, you want to feed about 5% every 7 to 14 days. I document all feeding days and the weight of the prey in my google calender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should be weighing your snake at least once a month to track how much you should be feeding. You should not disturb or move or handle your snake for at least 48 hours after feeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frozen / Thawed&lt;/em&gt;
I get the rat out the night before the day I want to feed. I put it in the fridge. About two hours before I feed, I get it out of the fridge and put it on the counter to get it to room temp. And then I soak it in a zip lock bag in warmish water (I use a temp gun to get water around 110F) for about 20 minutes, and use a temp gun to make sure the rat is around 100F, and then I run the head under running hot water until its 110F. The head of the prey should be warmer so the snake has a target. I then use tongs to move it around in the enclosure to mimic it being alive. She (usually) strikes pretty quickly. If she doesn't, I leave it in overnight, and throw it out in the morning if she doesn't eat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer frozen thawed cause I can buy cheaply in bulk. It's also safer. As ball pythons get bigger, they require larger prey - and rats have sharp teeth and sharp claws and can seriously injure your snake. Mice are not as nutriucious as rats, and as your ball python gets older, mice will be too small to be a full meal, meaning you will have to feed multiple prey items. Feeding multiple prey items is stressful on the snake and usually after they swallow one, they are reluctant to try another. The sooner you switch to rats, the easier your life will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Myths of Cage Aggression&lt;/em&gt;
You do not need a separate cage for feeding it. This is a myth. The best way to reduce stress at feeding time is to feed in their regular enclosure. This minimizes the risk of regurgitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Substrate&lt;/em&gt;
Stay away from aromatic woods - such as pine. A lot of people like to use coconut husk, unprinted newspaper, or paper towels. Newspaper and paper towels are cheap and it is easy to clean up messes. They do not help raise humidity, though. &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2v1uckY"&gt;Coconut husk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2fd4DIs"&gt;ReptiHhip&lt;/a&gt; are great for a naturalistic look and can help keep or raise humidity. They require soaking in water before hand, and then either allowing to dry or baking. I will soak them in water over night, and then let them air dry for a bit before throwing them in the stove for about an hour at 250F. After I get them out, I let them cool down and then add to the enclosure. You can remove them both, rinse and bake them multiple times. These should last a year before you need to buy new. I scoop out the solid wastes when I see them, and then every few months rinse and bake. There might be small wood mites in these, but the baking process or boiling it before hand should kill them. There should not be snake mites in these. Either way, boiling or baking will kill them. If you have a chip type substrate and are worry about ingestion of substrate while feeding, put a plate down before hand. Aspen can mold super easily so not really recommended unless you want to be changing out your substrate often, which might stress out your ball python.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wanted to formally announce my forthcoming novella, due to be released this fall. It is an #ownvoices queer re-telling of &lt;em&gt;Swan Lake,&lt;/em&gt; and I am really excited to share it with you when it comes out. I am going to be self-publishing this novella, just as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MS9NU7F"&gt;The Resignation Letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was self-published. &lt;a href="https://juneberrydesign.myportfolio.com/"&gt;Louisa&lt;/a&gt; will again be doing the cover for me, and I've asked Jen of &lt;a href="http://www.clearingblocksediting.com/"&gt;Clearing Blocks Editing&lt;/a&gt; to help me out with making sure everything is PERFECT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been putting together and &lt;a href="https://www.pinterest.com/daxaeterna/a-lake-of-feathers-and-moonlight/"&gt;pinterest board&lt;/a&gt; for it, and I hope you'll check that out. I've also definitely got a playlist for when I am writing it, here are the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXynmGGrclnddDFOND_5TPoYX5hx48SwXvW60gMuRVsEokrWeAkWfnFkzGrJ11XMDbIPk2LbhD65yEFC23oZ4hJrxlkuZ8Q%3D%3D"&gt;top songs&lt;/a&gt; on it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Girl in a Coma - As the World Falls Down&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blackmore's Night - Where Are We Going From Here&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fleetwood Mac - Rhiannon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stevie Nicks - Beauty and the Beast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blackmore's Night - Gilded Cage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kate Voegele - Devil In Me (Live Demo)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distant Worlds/Nobou Uematsu - Distant Worlds with Susan Calloway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blood Ceremony - Goodbye Gemini&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Florence and the Machine - Howl&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Florence and the Machine - Cosmic Love&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the potential blurb:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the center of the forest there is a lake. On a cool night, moonbeams kissed the waters and Katya was born. Since then she has kept company with the crows and the eccentric sorcerer, Ivan, who has made his home there. She soars through the night as a swan alongside her crow sisters, and does errands for Ivan during the day. She never believed that her life would every be spent any differently, being content with her minor magics and charms and safe beside Ivan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When a group of soldiers escorting the princess Yi Zhen from neighboring kingdom of Shān come through her woods, she is shocked to find Ivan taking the princess as his prisoner. He asks Katya to disguise herself as another captive to glean information from the princess. Thus she spends her days feigning captivity alongside a princess whom she is slowly falling for.  A princess who is betrothed to the Princen Alexis of Lebedia, who is surely searching for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Katya finds herself entwined in a complex web of politics, grudges, betrayal and heartache spanning centuries. At the heart of this web she must find out who she is, and what she stands for, and what she is willing to sacrifice to stay true to herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A nuanced re-telling of "Swan Lake" from the perspective of the black swan, this story explores love and loyalty, how both are won, earned, destroyed, or betrayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to request an Advanced Reader Copy, please let me know by reaching out to me on &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/daxaeterna"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I am hoping to have some ARC's out in September.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Review: The Seafarer's Kiss by Julia Ember</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;content note: discussion of rape, trans misogyny, violence against trans people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was incredibly excited when I heard about "The Seafarer's Kiss" by Julia Embers - it seemed like everything I love. It was a fairy tale retelling. It was told from the point of view of the traditional villain in that tale, and it was going to be queer and it was going to have a character that uses they/them pronouns. In case you missed it, I am queer and non-binary, and my pronouns are fey/fem/feir/feirs/femself, just like they/them/their but with an 'f' - so I was so ready for a book with someone who seemed like me, multiple someones, perhaps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited because the author is bi, like me. The author is poly, like me. And from reviews of the authors other work, "Unicorn Tracks", it seemed as hough the author really cared about getting representation &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. I was very sorely disappointed and hurt by this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started out very, very good. We meet Ersel, a mermaid who lives in an ice glacier somewhere near Norway, and who is very upset by the upcoming Grading. In the world Ersel lives in, mermaids are judged based on how fertile they are. At 19 years old they take part in a ritual to determine their fertility, and are then coerced into choose a mate. Once mated, many of these young women are confined to the darkness and spend the rest of their lives laying eggs. It's pretty patriarchal, and the reader immediately identifies with Ersels desire for a different future. Ersel, like many YA lady protagonists, declares herself not like the other girls a ton during this exposition on her plight. Many other mermaids of Ersel's age are shown taking care of themselves in an effort to increase their fertility, including Vigdis, who is sometimes cruel to Ersel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Ersel's "not like the other girls" characteristics is that she explores shipwrecks, and steals treasures from them and hides them in her cave in their ice home. Her best friend, Havamal, used to go with her, but since he joined the King's Guard, he has been busy. He also believes he is now grown up, and doesn't need the childhood fantasy they used to share of running away. He chides Ersel for her continued desire to escape their patriarchal king and her ongoing searches of the water tombs of humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the grading happens, it turns out Ersel is incredibly fertile, probably the most fertile mermaid their clan has seen. They need to reproduce, as their clan is dying out. It also turns out that she was born in the season of Loki, something she hadn't really considered or known before. In a cruel twist of irony, Vigdis is not fertile, despite all her attempts. Vigdis is crushed, forelorn, and despondent by this news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything changes when Ersel happens upon a stranded sheild maiden, Ragna, trapped on the ice. Ersel decides to help this human, and brings her food, wood of sunken ships, and helps keep her warm so that Ragna can fix the lifeboat she escaped the sinking ship on and sail back home. Ragna was stolen from her villaige as a gift for someone else, and she intends to find this someone else and extract revenge. Ersel identifies with Ragna's desire for freedom, and the two share a very cute moment. The cuteness doesn't last as Ersel is caught by Havamal, who threatens to report her to the king. He is a huge asshole, telling her he will spare Ragna's life if Ersel agrees to be his mate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling trapped and hopeless, she is confronted by Loki. Loki offers her a wish if she obtains a mermaids voice for them. Ember's version of Loki is genderfluid, or non-binary, and uses they them pronouns. Anyone familiar with Norse mythology would know that Loki is the trickster god. Ember stays true to this, and Loki is not to be trusted. Ersel makes a deal anyways. Ersel finds Vigdis, and tells her that if she gives up her voice, she can have the fertility she wants. Vigdis agrees, and asks for a mate, too. Ersel takes the voice back to Loki, and asks for legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loki grants her legs, but they are not the legs of a human that Ersel had imagined, but instead the legs of an octopus. And Vigdis? A mate in the form of a monster comes for her, and she does indeed become pregnant, and later dies from the pregnancy. Ersel is expelled from her clan, and forced to live elsewhere, making her own way and getting her own fod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Loki visits her again, she strikes another deal, this time trying to outsmart the trickster god. At this point, I was incredibly upset. The only character who seemed to not be a binary cis person was Loki. Loki had been cruel, deceiptful, and their actions had resulted in what I would consider to be rape. The monster that had come for Vigdis had originally come in the form of a handsome merman, and she consented to that intercourse. But then the creature had changed, and she was distraught to find herself deceived. The resulting pregnancy was not a normal occurance for merfolk, the pregnancy was like that of a mammal, and her body was not equipped for it. She and the fetus she carried died during delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loki laughed at this, and Loki laughed at this while using Vigdis's voice. Loki's own voice had been sealed by Thor, and they needed to steal other voices to be able to communicate. I was very sickened by what Loki was doing, and I believe that was the point. The readers are supposed to be upset, Loki is a villain, and villains need to be evil. What Loki did was beyond a moral event horizon for most people on this Earth. This would have been good story telling, this would have been good villain writing if Loki wasn't a trans non-binary person. If Loki wasn't the only trans person, the only non-binary person, in the novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ersel goes on to make another deal with Loki, and we learn that the creature that they had set upon Vigdis had once been a human, and Loki had transformed them into a monster and took away their free will. There is a hard to read conversation where this creature explains that during this time, he becomes a passive observer of what Loki is using their body for, but sometimes he enjoys it. This is a pretty nuanced character, where we see how badly he has been abused, and how some part of him is in conflict over how he feels when this happens. His body had been used by Loki to rape Vigdis, and he was conflicted about if the monstrosity was inside him all along, or if that was something that Loki had put inside of him. I both hated and pitied him, and Ersel granted him freedom in death. I was pretty impressed with how well that scene was handled, and I had hopes that my discomfort with how Loki was being handled would end up being righted, and Ember would grant nuance to Loki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong. Loki tries very hard for much the rest of the novel to out-trick Ersel, going so far as to say they invented lying, they invented deception. At about 80%, Ersel finishes her last bargain with Loki, having done some pretty amoral things to get there. With the help of her mother, she is able to get her mermaid form back, and she is able to transform herself into a human, or take on her octopus-like form, too. Loki gives her the information she needs to take down the patriarchal tyrant and then departs. We don't see them again. The remaining 20% of the book is a pretty great plot to overthrow the patriarchy, which I am always down for, but I couldn't enjoy it. I was too hurt by how Loki had been handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know the author is bi, and I want to believe her intentions were good, that she was trying to add diversity to her book. I don't know if she had sensetivity readers for Loki, and if she did, I don't know what they said. They might have liked the portrayal for all I know. But I was hurt. Trans people are currently cast in our society as liars, deceivers, con artist who lie about their gender in order to trick people. We are cast as villains trying to trick our way into spaces that aren't ours, like bathrooms. "Trans panic", in which a cis person, usually a man, finds out that the woman he is dating is trans and murders her, is a defense that has been held up in a court of law. You can claim "trans panic" and not get sentenced to prison for murder. And this defense works because it relies on the falsity that trans people are tricksters, liars, masters of deception and that this deception is so heinous that a citizen can act as judge, jury and executioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book has one trans character, and that character is literally the inventor of lying. The god of deception. The master of deceit. Can you see how this is harmful? Can you see how this perpetuates false, negetive stereoptypes about trans people? How this reinforces the narrative that society has crafted about us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Loki is genderqueer, non binary, genderfluid. We are further marginalized for this refusal to be inside the gender binary. We are doing it for attention, we are making it up, we are not "right" - we get mocked with phrases like "I identify as an attack helicopter," we can't even change our gender markers in most places. To have the only non-binary character in your book be a liar is not helping to dispell any of these sentiments about us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so little representation of genderqueer, non-binary people in books, especially in YA. I was trying to think of positive examples of this done right after someone on twitter asked me for recommendations. I've been throught this before, I am bi, and I spent so much time trying to track down books with a bi protagonist. Or any bi people at all. I had so few examples when I was growing up. I am so glad to see there is now a great selection of YA books with bi protagonists. But options for enby's are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so little representation, I think it was incredibly harmful. I believe a second enby character in this book, one who was positive and good and whom the reader knew had a moral compass, would have gone a long way towards allowing Loki to be complicated, messy, villainous, without unintentionally tying their evilness to their genderqueerness. Maybe in the future every book will have enbies in them, and we can have full on evil enbies because being enby is just accepted and of course enbies aren't a monolith. But without the good enbies saving the world in YA to counterbalance the bad enbies wrecking shit in YA, I can't find a way to see anything in Loki but a harmful propagation of stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to be perfectly clear, I am not hurt by Loki being the villain. I am hurt by the way that villainy is portrayed. If Loki was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a god of lies and deception and trickery, I think this would have been a very different review. I am hurt by the fact that we have scarcely any positive representation at all and that this was sold as positive representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this book had some great cis bi, lesbian, queer woman rep. It was really cute, and really fun. But no amount of really good, really positive cis queer rep can make a really bad portrayal of a trans enby justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few other things I wanted to point out that irked me a bit about this, and makes me leery to rec it to others. First, the main couple phsyically assault each other, and it felt really unnecessary. It felt out of place. The dialogue was conveying the conflict in view points between the two, there was no reason that I could see for their conflict to escalate to physical violence. The fact that neither apologizes for hitting the other, and that a very short amount of time later, they were back to being incredibly cute, felt like the violence was normative and ok. It wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I mentioned the not like other girls thread earlier. It does end up resolving with "all the other girls felt just as trapped as you did," but it definitely could have been more explored as to how Ersel felt when realizing that. The start of the book was so heavy on this, and it felt like an afterthought at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, at the end, when they are confront one of the villains, Ersel comments that she used to think this particular villain was handsome, but now she can see his pockmarked face and "maybe the cruelty inside him was beginning to show on the outside." I really hate this line. Can we not equate beauty with goodness? This seems to undo all the work that was done for the previous 90% of the novel in showing that Ersel's kraken form was not a reflection of what was inside.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Survival Rout is a story with a diverse cast of characters, who must find a way to work together to escape their faery captors. The point of view switches between Aniyah and Keoki. Aniyah is captured and placed with a group of other young people, mostly people their captors assume to be women. Keoki is placed with a group of young people their captors assume to be men. Aniyah and her new friends are "Prizes" for when Keoki and his new friends win in fights. The boys fight magical monsters, and their captor makes money off of betting on these matches. The girls are sent to the boys when they win, to do with as they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these captive humans have magical amnesia, and cannot remember anything about their life prior to the capture. The author uses this to explore sexual relationships outside of society. Some of the boys are incredibly kind and considerate, asking permission and getting consent, or what can count as near-consent, as the boys happiness the next morning determines if the girl lives or dies. At least one of the boys is not so nice. There was a lot here to unpack, and I feel that Mx Mardoll did a good job of keeping the story moving, and also taking the time to confront that the capacity for violence is not always societies doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mx. Mardoll also does a stunning job in exploring being trans, and being queer. Many of the characters in this novel might have had their memory wiped, but they still carry with them the sense that they are trans or queer in some capacity, even without the words to describe these feelings they have about their own identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I really appreciated was how the book dealt with disabilities. There are two characters with visible disabilities, both of them needing assistance with mobility at times. I don't want to spoil anything, but each character deals with their disability in different ways, while both being supportive of the others choice in how to deal with that. I appreciated that a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is a really fun novel, and I appreciated that it detoured from the fun magical kissing and romance to sometimes deal with the nuances and complications of human relationships, and that the times when a character clearly goes beyond a moral event horizon, the characters respond to this act in messy, human ways,while it still being clear to the reader that no matter how the characters respond, the BAD THING a character did was very not okay. You might have noticed that this is book two. You don't need to have read the previous book to enjoy Survival Rout, the events of this book happen after "Poison Kiss" but it stands on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I adopted a snake recently! Her name is Melusina, she was hatched in July 2016 and she is a yellow belly ball python. "Yellow belly" is her "morph" - what snake breeders use to describe patterns / markings / genetics. There's a whole system of dominate / co-dominate / recessive traits breeding that goes on to make some really awesome looking snakes. "Ball python" is the type of snake she is. Ball pythons are medium sized snakes that are non-venomous. They are constrictors, which means they kill their prey by squeezing them. They are also sometimes called "royal pythons" because royalty in sub-Saharan nations would sometimes wear them as jewelry. The monikor "ball python" comes from the fact that balling up is their response to pretty much anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/melusina_flames.JPG" alt="a ball python's backside as wrapped around a human wrist" style="max-width: 50%; float: left;" /&gt;
Yellow bellies have "flames" coming up from their bellies. So the pattern would normally be solid black, but instead, inside of the black, there are some orange-ish flames. You can see my snakes "flames" pretty well in the light. Yellow bellies also have an orange smudgey triangle on their heads. It's a morph that was first "discovered" in 1999, and it's a dominante gene. If you breed two yellow bellies together, you will probably get a super yellow belly, or what is known sometimes as an ivory, which is a snake that is mostly all off- white with a very faint yellow pattern. Melusina's dad was an ivory ball python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/world_of_pets.jpg" alt="farm animals at a pet expo, including goats and miniature horse" style="max-width: 50%; float: right;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've wanted a pet snake for awhile now, and have had my heart set on ball pythons since college, when one of my sorority sisters had a snake she kept in her dorm room and sometimes brought out for various campus events. A few weeks ago I was at the Maryland World of Pets Expo with my friend &lt;a href="http://uncorkedunwrapped.com"&gt;Liz&lt;/a&gt; and we had a ton of fun meeting goats, alpacas, very large rabbits, very small horses, ducks, dogs who did tricks, cats who slept, and lots and lots of very good dogs that Brent would approve of. We eventually found our way to the reptile dealers, where some woman was very non-chalantly holding a scorpion. Down a little ways from her was a ton of snakes, and I asked if I could hold one. I ended up holding a banana ball python, and really wanted to take her home with me. The dealer said he could set up a kit for me and I could take the snake home with me today! However, the partner that I live with is kinda really scared of snakes. I texted anyways asking if it was ok, very jokingly. I didn't get a response until after we were pulling out of the expo and heading back home. But the response was "Sure."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I spent the next few days talking it over, doing some research, and triple checking that my partner was actually fine with me getting a python. I called up some Petco's and Petsmarts to ask if they carried ball pythons, not because I wanted to purchase one from a chain retailer, but because I wanted to know if they might have the correct supplies for me. I got on craigslist and tried to find some snakes for adoption on there, but wasn't really finding any ball pythons. I googled for reptile stores in DC, and found one in Baltimore. Finally I did the desperate thing and got on reddit, which is how I found &lt;a href="http://morphmarket.com"&gt;MorphMarket&lt;/a&gt;, which is a pretty new site, but it has inventory of hundreds of reptile breeders and reptile specialty stores, you can look by reptile type, and on the ball python end you could look on genetics, making it easy to find an Ivory (or "super yellow belly") or Banana or Albino or really any other fancy patterns. I used their map functionality to find a breeder (&lt;a href="https://www.osmunreptiles.com/"&gt;Osmun Reptiles&lt;/a&gt;) about twenty minutes from my place, and used MorphMarket to send an inquire about a hatchling he had. He responsed very promptly, and gave me a ton of good info about her. I let him know I was pretty local and while he could ship the snake, I wanted to pick her up in person and not risk it with it being winter. Breeders can often overnight live reptiles by putting heating packs in the box, but if there is a problem and it gets delayed, or it gets left on your porch and you don't get home for several hours, it can turn disasterous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With payment made and pick up arranged for the upcoming weekend, I started shopping for supplies for her. I waded through tons of care sheets from pet stores and pet supply manufacturers like Zoo Med and Zilla. I watched YouTube Videos from LLL Reptiles and other places like them on how to set up a snake habitate. They all had glass acquariums with screen tops, and said you needed a heating lamp and an under tank heater, like a heating pad. They said you could get a cheap substrate like aspen shavings, and that the heater went on one side (which would be your snakes "hot" side) and the other side should not have a heater (and be your snakes "cool" side). Most of them said you should have a "hide" on each side, or a small dark enclosure in which your snake could hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to reddit, ready to ask questions that the videos did not answer. I went back /after/ I'd purchased a lot of stuff. I started reading, and reading, and reading, not quiet wanting to ever actually need to post on reddit, and therefore combing through the archives trying to find what I needed. The first thing I found was a rather tragic post of someone's snake removing the stick on thermometer in the tank and getting stuck to it. This did not end well for the snake, and I was really sad. I then checked the thermometer I'd purchased. Oops. Same one. I learned that if there is an adhesive surface in the tank, the snake will find a way to get to it, so don't stick anything to the tank walls with tape, sticky tack, command strips, etc. If you need to attach something to the tanks inner walls, use hot glue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing I learned is that tanks are actually pretty bad for snakes! They don't hold heat, and with the screen top, it makes keeping the necessary heat in a constant battle. With a screen top, humditiy also becomes difficult to maintain. A ball pythons cool side should always be above 75 F, and the warm side should not ever be above 95 F, preferrably no higher than 90 F. The humidity should always be above 50%, and during shed, it should be around 70%. I also had purchased aspen bedding, which sucks up a lot of moisture, and misting your tank to try to get the humidity up could easily cause a mold outbreak in the aspen substrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found links to places like &lt;a href="http://www.apcages.com/home/"&gt;Animal Plastics&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://pvccages.com/"&gt;PVC Cages&lt;/a&gt;. I know the webpages is incredibly sketchy looking, but multiple people on reddit vouched for it, and several of them I saw in multiple threads explaining how to treat snake emergencies, so I started to trust them even though they were often not the most pleasant people, since they obviously just wanted snakes to live a happy life. These enclsures were advocated as a pretty optimal place to keep a pet snake. You can buy the enclosure, the heating sources, and lighting sources all at once. They apparently last decades, and require very little by way of cleaning and upkeep. I'd already sunk a ton of money into my supplies, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already knew that baby ball pythons can get really scared of large spaces, so while mine is just a hatchling, she would need a smaller space. So I decided to try to make the best of what I had, and save up for a larger enclosure for her by way of either PVC Cages or Animal Plastics. First, I got two &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2kQT4XB"&gt;heating pads&lt;/a&gt;. These are adhesive, and meant to be stuck to the outside bottom of your tank, not the inside. The thing they don't tell you is that they can't really be bent, and bending them breaks them. So once it's on the tank, it's not coming off without breaking. However, as I learned on reddit, you can use the adhesive to stick it on tin foil, and then tape it onto the bottom outside of the tank with a heat resistant tape. I put one at each end of my tank, since it's glass and not great at heat. I then plugged them both into a &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2kHYwcU"&gt;thermostat&lt;/a&gt;. On the one side I set the temperature to 90F, and on the other, 78F. These aren't the most expensive thermostats, and there are some that are $600 USD and made specifically for reptile enclosures. This way the temperature in the enclsure would always be above 75F. The thermostates have probes to check the temperature, they come with suction cups. Don't be tempted to put the probes inside the enclosure. Instead put them in between the heating pad and the glass, the snake will find a way to move them, and if the snake sits on it in the enclsure, you might end up with a wrong temperature reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then got a foam poster board, and cut it up and taped it to the back and the sides of the glass tank. This achieves two things. First, it makes the snake feel more secure. Second, it acts as insulation for the glass, helping to keep the heat in. In addition, I got saran wrap and covered abut two-thirds of the screen top. I was now getting the right temperature readings, so I didn't need to rely on a heat lamp, and could use LED lights to illuminate the enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered bricks of &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2leYqNx"&gt;coconut fiber&lt;/a&gt; substrate, which I then soaked in water and put in. I didn't soak it in too much water, just enough to get it to not be so compact. This helped keep the humidity up, and didn't have such a high risk of mold that the aspen bedding did. YOu don't need much substrate, you could actually get away with using papertowels as substrate if you wanted. I like the look of the coconut husks and it's helpful during shed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the mistake of ordering too small a water bowel, none of the care sheets or videos from Big Brands explained that the snake should be able to fully fit into the water bowel in some manner. So I made sure to go to a pet store and find an appropriate sized one instead of relying on internet measurements to try to figure out if she could fit in it. Snakes will sometimes soak themselves in their water bowels to help with shedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the probes used for the thermostates, I have two other &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2lf6HRy"&gt;thermometers and hygrometers&lt;/a&gt; in the enclosure. One at each end, so that I can always have a feel for what is going on. I plan on getting an infrared thermometer in the future, but right now these are working well and I am making sure that it stays above 50%. So far with the coconut husks and the fact that I myself prefer at least 50% humidity, this isn't a problem. Melusina's enclsure is in a room where I have a giant 3.5 gallon humdifier that I have set up for my own personal comfort, I understand not everyone does this though, so you might have to take other measure to keep your snake happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2kIadjK"&gt;hides&lt;/a&gt; for her, and she spends a lot of the day in them. The hides are identical. As I learned, hides should be the same size, and those hollowed out logs don't really give them security, even if one end is butted up against glass. So far Melusina really likes the ones I have for her. You can use pretty much anything for hides as long as they are the same size. The reason for this is that in the wild a snake could have its pick of hides, and so will look for one that meets its temperate and size needs for its own security. If one is too small or too big, it can go find another one. In captivity, a snake can't be Goldilocks. The snake can really only pick between the hides that we give. So if the snake feels safe in the warm hide, but needs to thermoregulate and be cooler, the snake might have to choose between feeling safe and thermoregulating. She has some fake plants, too. Most of which I bought in the fish section, because for some reason they were cheaper. She also has a fake log that stays in the middle of the tank that she will sometimes climb on at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for food, I order her food online. Be warned, the shipping is a big pricy, and it will come packaged with dry ice. But the mice and rats themselves are pretty cheap. I bought her 50 frozen prey for $12, plus $50 shipping. The breeder suggested to me &lt;a href="http://www.perfectprey.com/"&gt;PerfectPrey&lt;/a&gt; but there are other places you can buy too. I can't so far find frozen prey local to me (which is weird, this is a major city…but I guess DC is a fairly conservative city as far as pets go?). I also picked up some tongs which I use to hold the prey when I attempt to feed her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feed her frozen/thawed mice, which was what the breeder also fed her. Ball pythons are docile, shy, and not always interested in food. Live feeding can be lethal to the snake if the snake isn't wanting to feed and the prey is wanting to fight, especially if the prey is a bigger rat. The prey items are humanely killed and then I thaw them, warm them up to a body temperature without cooking them, and then feed to Melusina. I also feed her in her enclosure, there is no need to move a snake to a different tank to feed them. This way the snake isn't stressed out from being somewhere else. Feeding in the enclosure won't cause "cage aggression" and won't train your snake to think you hand is food every time you open the cage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more things: you can also apparently &lt;a href="https://ball-pythons.net/forums/showthread.php?139156-Vypyrz-Tub-Set-Up-The-Basics-*DUW*"&gt;use sterilite or rubbermaid bins as snake enclosures&lt;/a&gt;, they hold heat and humidity better than glass tanks, and you can do pretty much the same set up, with some accomodations for making sure the under tank heaters don't melt the plastic. You use a soldering iron to put some holes in the side, and make sure it has secure clips to keep the lid on. If it doesn't, you can use luggage thing ma bobs to keep it closed. The draw back is you don't have the crystal clear view of your snake. It's cheap though! The PVC enclosures I talked about earlier have the crystal clear view of glass, and the heat/humidity retention of bins. Some of the links that I saw posted over and over again in reddit were really helpful to me, and they might be helpful to you too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://reptimes.com/ball-pythons-feeding/"&gt;Ball Pythons Feeding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've sure learned a lot about snake keeping, and I hope if you have the means, you go for the PVC enclosures, but if you are like me and already have all the stuff for a glass tank, hopefully this can help you get a good set up until you can afford to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh…and about my partner that is terrified of snakes? Totally in love with Melusina now &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
