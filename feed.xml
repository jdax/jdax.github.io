    <title>Review: Slaying Dragons by Sasha L. Miller</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received a copy of Slaying Dragons by Sasha L. Miller from NetGalley and Less Than Three Press in exchange for an honest review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaying Dragons is a novella of about 28,000 words, and each one of those words lingers. For a small story, there is a lot of world building done. The unnamed location is plagued by dragons, basilisks, wyrms, and other fantastic monsters. An organization comprised of mages and knights exists to eliminate these threats. Mages and combatants are paired temporarily to take on an assignment to kill one of these beasts, and then they receive new orders usually with a new partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devi, a strong woman with years of training, has not had so much luck in this department lately. After a series of bad partners lands her in hot water, she is surprised she has a new assignment but hopeful that the new partner won’t be as terrible as the noble who wanted the glory of being a battle mage without the work. Noeme, the mage, seems knowledgeable even if she’s never battled a dragon. Devi is cautiously hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reader, I was instantly rooting for Noeme and Devi. The attraction between the two was palpable and a pleasure to read. However, the will-they/won’t-they never detracted from the action of their dragon-slaying assignment. Likewise, the dragon-slaying action enhanced the will-they/won’t-they in a way that never felt contrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the ending was perfect and amazing and everything I ever could have asked for in an amazing novella of two cool ladies slaying dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing felt slightly off, as I expected the climax to be the dragon-slaying, but, spoilers. Once I figured this out, (and once Devi does, too), everything else seemed to fall into place, and the pacing seemed obvious. As this was an ARC, there were a few errors I noticed (at one point, near the end, Devi is referred to as a mage, when she’s very clearly not!) which I hope will be corrected for publication. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.lessthanthreepress.com/books/index.php?main_page=product_bookx_info&amp;amp;cPath=92&amp;amp;products_id=954"&gt;Less Than Three press to pre-order&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, read this if you want a fun short story of ladies killing dragons. Don’t read this if you don’t think ladies can kill dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was provided a copy of this book to review by NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox-Hat and Neko, by August Li, follows the tale of a "chosen one" born in Japan, and his journey from accepting his special powers to the final defeat of the antagonist. Along the way he befriends a fox spirit, a cat demon, a cheerful artist, a determined archer, an impoverished baker, a heartbroken antique dealer, and a enthusiastic English teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is as they seem, and many of his acquaintances have secrets they would prefer to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is interspersed with manga-esque black and white sketches, and the book takes on the feel of a manga in some capacity. While a lot of the book takes place in Japan, due to the nature of Ayumu Tsunkino's power to walk in an manipulate dreams, the book also takes on a dream like feel. The reader could easily become lost in these dream sequences, where the action can jump and characters can randomly be somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in these dream chapters that a lot of the character development happens, as people's darkest fears are exposed in a nightmare sequence. The artist, Chou, fears being trapped in a dull office job; Ikehara, the baker, feels trapped by his younger siblings and his obligations to his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel it prudent to point out that many of the characters are somewhere along the spectrum of queer sexuality. There is no push-back from any of their friends or family about this. This novel did not address homophobia and what LGBT teens might go through in terms of bullying or parental anger. None of the characters experienced any trauma for being queer, specifically. This was incredibly refreshing. There was one short conversation where a lesbian expressed fear to her bisexual girlfriend over losing her to a boy. Her girlfriend very firmly pointed out how awful that was, and why it was unfair. The lesbian listened, believed her, and apologized. Again, incredibly refreshing to see the stigma of bisexuality addressed and have a character apologize for engaging in it. As a queer woman, I already know what homophobia is, I experience it every day. I don't need to be shown it in fiction, too. My experiences aren't a plot device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing about this book that made me happy was it very briefly addressed polyamory. It might have been unintentional, but a character expresses a sentiment that she loves two people at the same time and wants them both. While this isn't acted on, I felt it appropriately handled how poly feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the amazingness that was good representation that let queer characters stand as their own people, this book was at times slow. There was a lot of telling in place of showing, and due to the dream-like nature of the battles, it became hard to follow at times. There were a few false-starts with figuring out who the Big Bad was, and it took, in my opinion, an incredibly long time for all of the back story to be fleshed out. It was teased for a long time, and it felt really drawn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, pick this up if you want to read thoughtful representations without all the homophobia laid bare. Also, maybe read this if you want to hear about Usagi Tsukino's cousin? I don't know about that, but it's really all I could think about. Maybe don't buy this if you are looking for either queer tragedy porn or don't like queer people?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to pick up Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler after I was recommended it by several people, and I am really glad I did. I know dystopian is all the rage now, but let me tell you, Butler had this genre down long before Katniss was even thought of. While the events of The Hunger Games seem unlikely, people recognize that some part of human nature could allow that to happen, and to continue. Butler, though, shows an all too real and all too likely future dystopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her dystopia has all the hallmarks of ages gone by, those days we shudder and sigh about, saying "we didn't know better." Debt slavery, the buying and selling of children for labor, a government quickly selling off public assets to private companies and those companies making life hell for the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story centers on a young black woman with a strange birth defect (the ability to feel others pain, said to be the result of her mothers drug addiction) growing up in what was a solid middle class neighborhood and is now struggling to get by. The neighborhood has a wall around it to keep the poor out. Notably, it is a neighborhood in denial about how bad things are getting, and how close to being poor they themselves are. Lauren is not so naive. She sees the poor people beyond the wall as the inevitable future. She knows that one day people will be so angry at their situation, and see the 'wealth' that is their neighborhood, and try to attack. Her father, a preacher, knows this too and tries to get their neighbors on the right track to be able to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren's tactics are different than her fathers. So different that she forms an entirely new religion called Earthseed, the destiny of which is to spread across the stars. Lauren's belief system is about change and it's inevitability, it is about learning how to adapt to change, and learning how to use that change to one's advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is highly relatable, as Lauren grows up and sees a very bleak feature in their gated community. Getting a job is incredibly hard, and while both her parents have jobs, and the neighbors all own their houses, her generation cannot hope for so much. The most they can hope for is to get married and have their own room in their parents house. Lauren wants something bigger, but the current state of the country doesn't seem hospitable to her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack she fears finally does come, and she and two peers are the only known survivors. They head north, and along the way find more desperate people. A family, former debt slaves, a doctor, and more people who are looking for something better. Each person meaningfully challenges Lauren's ideals and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic book that I highly recommend. Read this book if you want to add diversity to your reading list, if you want to read about humanity at it's worst, and see it at it's best.&lt;/p&gt;
