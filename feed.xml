    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second part of a multi-part series on self publishing. This series will cover: writing, editing, beta reading, sensitivity reading, setting up a pre-order, using Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle Select, NetGalley and other means of getting reviews, and marketing. &lt;a href="http://daxmurray.com/blog/so-you-want-to-self-publish/"&gt;Read part one on writing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://daxmurray.com/blog/self-publishing-part-two-editing/"&gt;read part two on editing, beta readers and sensitivity readers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people have asked me several questions on self publishing on Kindle. I've talked to people who want to publish small technical books that, for one reason or another, O'Reilly doesn't want to publish. I've talked to fiction writers who want to publish a novel. I've talked to a lot of people who have thought "I wish I could…" And I want to tell you that you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of steps, and they do not always have a 'correct' order. But they are achievable and you can determine what order you want them to happen in for a lot of them. There are some cart before the horse problems, but largely, writing is the first step, and hitting publish is the last. Everything between there is a malaise of interlooping and overlapping steps to make the writing publishable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a small power point last April to share at a technical conference with other Rails devs who have small or niche book ideas. I am going to heavily self plagarize from that for this post. So if some of my cat photos look familiar to you, that's why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been writing stories since I was five. My first one went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There once was a cat. The cat loved to eat. The cat loved to nap. The cat loved her human. Her human went to school sometimes. That made the cat sad. But the human always came home. The end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure my mother still has the bare book complete with hand drawn illustrations somewhere. I actually minored in creative writing in college, and while most of my classes focused on poetry, the itch for stories never left. I was just as confused and scared by the self-publishing maze as anyone else. I won't lie and say it is easy, but it is definitely easier than you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cover-art"&gt;Cover Art&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to set up a successful pre-order, you will need a cover. If you are artsy and great with Photoshop, you can try to make this on your own. If you are not, you will want to hire someone. This is another place where I suggest not attempting to be frugal. Sometime in the middle of having early readers and editors, you will want to hire this cover artist. I hired &lt;a href=""&gt;Louisa of Juneberry Design&lt;/a&gt; to make my covers. Look at an artist's portfolio, see what else they have done and if you think they can execute on your vision. Look at other self published books in your genre and find covers you like. Ask the authors who they hired to do their cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find other books in your genre, the ones that you know are making money, self pub'd or not, and see what elements they use. I know Stephen King is the god of the horror genre, and his covers very prominently display his name. Don't do this. Stephen King could sell books by having nothing &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; his name on the cover. You can't. You aren't a 'big name' (yet), so you will want a cover that sells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have chosen an artist, you will want to provide this artist with at least the basic gist of the story, the tone, and the genre. Many genre's have a certain feel or style for their covers. Look at some of the bestsellers in your genre and pass those covers onto your artist, letting them know what you do and do not like about them. This can be very back and forth. The artist will probably send you early drafts or stock art and ask how you feel about it. Be honest. If the artist picks a stock art model that looks nothing like how you imagined the character, let them know. It is sometimes helpful to pass along your own images that you might have grabbed way back when you were making character profiles. They will probably not be able to use those images as they are copyrighted, but they can get a better idea of what you are going for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kindle does have its own cover maker. I do not suggest using this. You want your book to look original, and Kindle only has so many stock photos. There is a saying, "do not judge a book by its cover," but no one actually follows that when it comes to books. A professional looking cover tells a reader that they can expect professional level storytelling. There are numerous examples where this was not true, and yet people still have this assumption. You will not be able to convince them otherwise. Have a professional cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost for this can be anywhere from $75 to $300, sometimes more depending on who you are hiring. It is absolutely worth every penny to have a top notch cover. There are people on Fivrr or other freelancing sites that offer these services for $5 to $10. I know this is tempting. But what you will end up with is a cover you could had your cat make by setting her on the keyboard while MS Paint is open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ebooks, you just need the front cover. If you are going to choose the paperback route as well, you will need a back and spine cover too. Usually you put this together as back, spine, front, left to right. Once you have your final manuscirpt uploaded, you can get the dimensions that you need. At first, I used amazon's cover creator for paperback, choosing to use the ebook cover and just type in my own summary and info on a solid colored back. It didn't turn out that great. So I asked Louisa to design a back / spine for me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top in both pictures is the one I asked Louisa to professionally create, bottom is what I tried to do myself with Amazon's paperback cover creator. Note the difference in fonts, and the overall better look of the one Louisa did for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/alofm_cover_comparison1.jpg" alt="two books sitting on top of each other, one with an awesome cover, the other not so much" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 45%;" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/alofm_cover_comparison2.jpg" alt="two books sitting on top of each other, one with an awesome cover, the other not so much" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 45%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louisa gave me back the full cover as an image file. But Amazon wants it as a pdf, and just saving the image as a pdf isn't gonna work. So I opened the cover creator, got the dimensions that Amazon wants, and then followed &lt;a href="http://ryallon.blogspot.com/2012/07/converting-book-cover-for-createspace.html"&gt;the instructions in this tutorial for making a cover for createspace&lt;/a&gt;. The height is going to be 9 inches, but the width wants to take into account the front and back plus the spine - the spine can change depending on how many pages you have. Keep this in mind when making changes to your manuscript - anything that adds or deletes pages will affect your paperback cover dimensions. This tutorial uses Open Office, which is a free suite of software similar to Microsoft Office. I've been using Open Office products since 2009 when I got my first ubuntu machine, so I was already familiar with lots of the tools. The tutorial also says its for Createspace, Amazon owns Createspace, and while this tutorial pre-dates that acquision, it's still a very good tutorial on using Open Office Draw to scale and save your cover as a pdf for Amazon. I would wait until you have your final final final manuscript, plus front copy, a table of contents, back copy, etc, all in one uploaded file before trying to size your paperback cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are truly in a rush, and you want people to be able to pre-order now, make a small cover that says "COVER COMING SOON." I am getting a little ahead of myself, but once you have your pre-order set up, you will want to get the title on Goodreads. Goodreads archives all versions of a cover except one that says "COVER COMING SOON." You do not want a cheaply made placeholder cover to be in the archives of your Goodreads listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="description"&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want around 200 words for the description. This should not be a synopsis, this should be the &lt;em&gt;stakes&lt;/em&gt;. There are a few rules when it comes to description writing for fiction: keep named characters to a minimum, don't include sub-plots, end on a question or the stakes. You want to hook the readers here, which is pretty hard to do seeing as there so very many books out there they could also be reading. For non-fiction, you want to tells readers what they will learn, how it will help them, and your authority and expertise on the subject. Regardless of what you are writing, you want to keep the description tight and short. Workshop this with friends, family, colleagues, and even your editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always change your description later, but you definitely want to get it to a good spot for launch. This is what you would want on your paperbacks back cover, too, if you are doing paperbacks. As I suggested with covers, look for books in your genre and see what they have as their description. Check out both self pubbed and traditionally published. Amazon will show you top books in genres, so use that to read those books descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="setting-up-the-pre-order"&gt;Setting up the pre-order&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why"&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will get into the ins and outs of pre-release marketing, but the long and the short is that during your pre-release marketing, you want people to be able to pre-order. You want them to be able to click that button while they are thinking about it. They will not remember to check back on release day to get it. Having a ton of pre-orders in will also help your ranks. If you start off with a ton of buys on release day, your book may make it to the top of the pages in Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how"&gt;How?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you want to navigate to &lt;a href="https://kdp.amazon.com"&gt;https://kdp.amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; and connect it to your regular Amazon Account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/kdp_landing.png" alt="KDP landing page, with links to log in or go to your account and a video tutorial" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 90%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will want your banking information, a version of your manuscript (does not have to be final), and your cover. Amazon will let indie authors set up pre-orders up to 90 days in advance of release and at least 10 days ahead of release. There might be a temptation to have a shorter pre-order window, but you will want those full three months for reasons I will get to later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banking and Tax Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will want to get your banking and tax information taken care of right away. Amazon pays out via paper checks mailed to you or direct deposits into your account. Thing is, they won't send out a check until you've had at least $100 in sales per market after the first 90 days. A "market" is basically a country or region, there is a US market, a UK market, etc. Some markets are super small and you might only ever get $0.10 from them. In check payment, this means you will probably never see that $0.10. But, you can get that at the end of the month if you have Electronic Funds Transfer enabled. So set this up for direct deposit so you can start getting paid sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/kdp_tax_information.png" alt="KDP success prompt saying Tax Info has been updated" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 90%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="creating-your-book"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating your book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your tax and banking information are done being entered, you will get to a dashboard called your "Bookshelf" - this is where all of your books will live. To start a new one, just click on the "+"! You can pick the ebook option now, and add paperback later if you decide to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/kdp_dashboard.png" alt="KDP dashboard with a list of books and a + sign to start to create a new one" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 90%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="ebook-details"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ebook Details&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of setting up your book is the details section. Many of these fields are optional, so if they do not apply to your book, you can leave them blank. You do need a language and a title. I picked English, as that is the language my book was written in. My book does not have a subtitle, it is not part of series and therefore does not have a series name or a series number. Yours might!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/kdp_step_1.png" alt="Ebook Details: A language drop down field, book title field, book sub title field, series name and series number fields." style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 90%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon will also as for edition numbers, I put 1 in here because this is the first edition. Should I make major changes or edits and re-publish, I would add that as edition 2! New cover? Also edition 2!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the author field, you can seriously put (almost) anything here. Don't want to use your legal name? That's cool. Want to use a pen name? Also cool! Amazon will let you have multiple names, too. So if this is your first book and it's about computers, you can use one name, and when you decide to start writing about competetive dog grooming, you can take up another pen name. You can have as many pen names as you want. I'd just steer clear of using something like "J.R.R. Tolkein" for what should be obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributors fields are if you are compiling an anthology or some other work with a ton of other people involved. I've seen it also used to credit editors (ask first!). You can certainly leave this blank if you don't have anyone else who contributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also you will need to provide your description. Pictured here is my not so great first stab at a description. It limits you on characters, but do noot feel compeled to use every character they offer - keep it around 200 words!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/kdp_step_2.png" alt="Ebook Details: Edition number field, author first and last name fields, contributors drop downs and first and last name fields and description large text field" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 90%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon then asks that you agree that you have the rights / copyright to your work. If you live in the US, this is pretty easy to do. You can either snail mail yourself a &lt;a href="https://store.usps.com/store/product/shipping-supplies/certified-mail-receipt-P_FORM_3800"&gt;certified mail&lt;/a&gt; print out of your manuscript, or you can email yourself a copy. Anything that puts a date on your work is enough for copyright. In most instances, this will be enough. Big name authors, like J.K. Rowling, get huge amounts of frivolous copyright claims (Rowling had someone after her for 'muggles'), the odds are that you won't be one of those big name authors and therefore will never have to produce huge amounts of evidence of copyright. Select the box, and move on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/kdp_step_3.png" alt="Ebook Details: A radio button input asking to verify that you hold the necessary rights to the works" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 90%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age and Grade Range are all optional, if you aren't writing childrens books, you can skip these fields. Just a quick note, though. A lot of organizations that attempt to create a rubric for what is appropriate for which ages/grades are incredibly homophobic and transphobic. For example, it has been shown that the MPAA regularly rates content with any sort of queer people in it as "R" even if that queer person never even so much as kisses anyone. Queer people and trans people specifically are not inherently sexual and are therefore not inherently inappropriate for children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/kdp_step_4.png" alt="Book Details: Drop down fields for minimum and maximum age range, and minimum and maximum grade levels" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 90%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="ebook-content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBook Content&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing it will ask you is if you want to DRM your book. As a full time software engineer, I just want to say: DRM is poorly written and shitty software. It doesn't at all protect your book, it is easily cracked, and if it is cracked, you have no recourse. I choose not the DRM my books because &lt;em&gt;it makes them accessible&lt;/em&gt;. DRM may prevent readers from using accessibility software. DRM may prevent them from using their own text-to-speech and more. Amazon DRM has also been found to further forced-obsolescence, wherein Amazon will attempt to get users to upgrade their device by making older devices no longer support some DRM'd content. A lot of older Kindles had better text-to-speech than the current ones. I don't want my readers to have to fight to read my book. So I don't use DRM. This also means that someone can buy my book on Amazon and read it on their Nook. Or on any other device that is best suited for them. It's a very important thing for me, but it may not be for you. Select which ever option you feel best about after doing your research on DRM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most confusing part! ISBN's! If you are doing ebook only, you don't need one. Really. For real. &lt;em&gt;But what if I want it on Goodreads?!&lt;/em&gt; Amazon will give you an ASIN, which Goodreads accepts and with that ASIN GR will be able to port in information about your book! If you decide to also do Paperback, Amazon will give you one for free. But really, you don't need one. If you want ebook only and really want an ISBN, you can pay $250 for one, or $1000 for 1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For "Publisher," you can leave it blank. It will display in store as Amazon Digital Services. You can also set up your own small press which will only publish your works and put that in there, too. It's your call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/kdp_step_5.png" alt="Ebook Content: text fields for ISBN and Publisher" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 90%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will ask you to upload your manuscript and your cover. It will have a previewer, and you should be able to download it too. I highly suggest downloading it and viewing it on some of your own reading devices! I also recommend asking someone else to do the same! Download it and email it to someone you trust to give an honest look over of it. I also use Calibre to convert my file into other formats and preview it there, too. Even after a zillion times of me looking it over, and others looking it over, I still find weird formatting errors sometimes. Make sure your manuscript has any title pages, copyright pages, dedications, etc that you want. I would suggest picking up a paperback and flipping through each of the first set of pages to see what all is where and when. Hard page breaks, not just hitting 'enter' until you get to a new page, are your friend. Look up how to use hard page breaks in your text editor of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="ebook-pricing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ebook Pricing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can get a bit confusing - you have two price options in Kindle, either &lt;em&gt;Kindle Select&lt;/em&gt; prices, or non- &lt;em&gt;Kindle Select&lt;/em&gt; prices. &lt;em&gt;Kindle Select&lt;/em&gt; means you will not publish your works anywhere else for sale. No iBooks. No nook. No SmashWords. No PDF on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;_Why would I agree to that?!?!?!?!?_&lt;/em&gt;
 - Better royalties.&lt;br /&gt;
 - Your book goes on Kindle Unlimited, and you get paid when someone borrows it.&lt;br /&gt;
 - Your book can into the Kindle Owners Lending Library (this is opt-in), and you get paid when someone borrows it.&lt;br /&gt;
 - You can use Countdown Deals and other promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to go this route. So far, I've liked it. I am starting to look at other options, though, such as IngramSpark, which offers wholesale discounts to schools and libraries. For the time being, I am still KDP Select.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KDP Select further breaks down your options as far as how much royalties you get. If you ebook is between $0.99 and $2.98, or over $9.99, you get 35% royalties. If you book is between $2.99 and $9.99, you get 70% royalties. I have my short story, &lt;em&gt;The Resignation Letter&lt;/em&gt;, for $0.99. I only get about $0.30 per purchase, but it is short, and a lot of people don't want to spend $3 on a short story. &lt;em&gt;A Lake of Feathers and Moonbeams&lt;/em&gt; is priced at $4.99, so I get about $4-ish per purchase. A lot of self-pub'd authors with multiple works will price some of them as perma-free or $0.99 as a hook to get readers to purchase the rest of their books. First books in series, shorts, etc - all priced super cheaply to give readers a glance at what they can expect from other works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Countdown Deals&lt;/em&gt; are when your book is temporarily on sale. You can reduce the price of your book once every 90 days and still keep your standard royalty. This means you can price your book at $2.99 and have the 70% royalty, and then for one week lower it to $0.99 and still get 70% of that. This can be a great marketing and promotion tool, especially if you tie it in with social media and blog promotion. It's during these sales that a lot of people will pay for BookBub to feature a book. I'll get more into marketing like this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For territories, if your work is an original work which no one else has ever published, and which you yourself have never published before, you most likely have world wide rights. Go ahead and select all territories to make your book available globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/kdp_step_6.png" alt="Ebook Pricing: Radio fields for KDP Select Opt In and Territories" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 90%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've set the price, you should be able to set a release date and make it available for pre-order! If you are using a draft manuscript to get the pre-order started, don't forget to upload the final version at least 72 hours before the book is live! Next time I will get in-depth with reviews!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven't figured it out yet, I am non-binary and I am bi. I also am an indie author. I watched the cool people posting on #nbvember and wanted to specifically write a post about some awesome indie authors who shared my marginalizations. This list is not comprehensive, I sent out a tweet asking people to share their works from this year with me. If I missed you, please let me know and I would be happy to add you. So I present to you, in no particular order, a list of the wonderful works of indie authors who are bi and/or non-binary. I am dividing this up into two parts, because WOW there are a lot and that makes me so happy. &lt;a href="http://daxmurray.com/blog/Bi-And-Or-Enby-Indie-Releases-of-2017/"&gt;Read Part One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven't figured it out yet, I am non-binary and I am bi. I also am an indie author. I watched the cool people posting on #nbvember and wanted to specifically write a post about some awesome indie authors who shared my marginalizations. This list is not comprehensive, I sent out a tweet asking people to share their works from this year with me. If I missed you, please let me know and I would be happy to add you. So I present to you, in no particular order, a list of the wonderful works of indie authors who are bi and/or non-binary. I am dividing this up into two parts, because WOW there are a lot and that makes me so happy. Don't forget to &lt;a href="http://daxmurray.com/blog/Bi-And-Or-Enbyof-2017-Part-Two/"&gt;checkout part two!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote a few things this year! Some of them are eligible for awards. If you've read and enjoyed my works this year, and would like to nominate them for awards, please feel free to do so! As far as I can tell, the following works are eligible for Hugo &amp;amp; Nebula awards in the Novel and Short Story categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, you might be asking, all of the works you released this year are self published! Are they &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; eligible? Yes, they are! According to the Hugo's official rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Self-published works, e-books, and other “non-traditionally” published works are eligible. There is no restriction requiring works to be published through “traditional” publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are the relevant rules for the Nebula Awards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;All works first published in English, in the United States, during the calendar year, in the genres of science fiction, fantasy, or a related fiction genre are eligible for the Nebula Awards® in their respective categories.
        Works first published in English on the Internet or in electronic form during the calendar year shall be treated as though published in the United States.
        Works are eligible whether or not their authors are members of SFWA.
        Works are eligible whether or not they have been previously published outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the categories, "best novel" and "best short story" are described by the Hugos as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Best Novel: Awarded for a science fiction or fantasy story of forty thousand (40,000) words or more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Best Short Story: Awarded for science fiction or fantasy story of less than seven thousand five hundred (7,500) words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by the Nebula Awards as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Short Story: less than 7,500 words;
    Novel: 40,000 words or more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2hEV8j8"&gt;A Lake of Feathers and Moonbeams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (47,500 words)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For as long as Katya can remember, her partner Ivan, a powerful sorcerer, has given her anything she's ever wanted. Life is simple, until soldiers escorting Princess Yi Zhen enter the magical woods they call home. When Ivan captures the princess and demands Katya watch over her, she reluctantly agrees, entering a dark web of political grudges spanning centuries. Katya soon finds herself falling for the captive princess — and is pretty sure the princess is into her, too. To make matters worse, Yi Zhen is betrothed to a roguish princen who's made it their mission to set her free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As forces rally to rescue Yi Zhen or go to war, Katya must take measure of her own powers and decide what she is willing to sacrifice. Will she retreat to the safety of what's familiar or give up everything she knows to spread her wings and fly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Lake of Feathers and Moonbeams&lt;/em&gt; was published in ebook and paperback on October 27, 2017. It is #ownvoices for bisexuality, anxiety, polyamory, and being non-binary. It was edited by &lt;a href="http://www.clearingblocksediting.com/"&gt;Jen Anderson of Clearing Blocks Editing&lt;/a&gt; and the cover art was created by &lt;a href="https://juneberrydesign.myportfolio.com/"&gt;Louisa Smith of Juneberry Design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(5,000 words)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amalthea has always gone against the rules, applying to the Academy of Mages first, and then studying forbidden magic when accepted. But when she finds her lover, the Empress, asking her to break the rules of her own ethics, she must decide for herself what is more important to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Resignation Letter&lt;/em&gt; was published in ebook format on January 30, 2017. It is #ownvoices for bisexuality. It was edited by &lt;a href="http://www.kathowardbooks.com/editing/"&gt;Kat Howard&lt;/a&gt; and the cover art was created by &lt;a href="https://juneberrydesign.myportfolio.com/"&gt;Louisa Smith of Juneberry Design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second part of a multi-part series on self publishing. This series will cover: writing, editing, beta reading, sensitivity reading, setting up a pre-order, using Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle Select, NetGalley and other means of getting reviews, and marketing. &lt;a href="http://daxmurray.com/blog/so-you-want-to-self-publish/"&gt;Read part one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people have asked me several questions on self publishing on Kindle. I've talked to people who want to publish small technical books that, for one reason or another, O'Reilly doesn't want to publish. I've talked to fiction writers who want to publish a novel. I've talked to a lot of people who have thought "I wish I could…" And I want to tell you that you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of steps, and they do not always have a 'correct' order. But they are achievable and you can determine what order you want them to happen in for a lot of them. There are some cart before the horse problems, but largely, writing is the first step, and hitting publish is the last. Everything between there is a malaise of interlooping and overlapping steps to make the writing publishable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a small power point last April to share at a technical conference with other Rails devs who have small or niche book ideas. I am going to heavily self plagiarize from that for this post. So if some of my cat photos look familiar to you, that's why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been writing stories since I was five. My first one went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There once was a cat. The cat loved to eat. The cat loved to nap. The cat loved her human. Her human went to school sometimes. That made the cat sad. But the human always came home. The end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure my mother still has the bare book complete with hand drawn illustrations somewhere. I actually minored in creative writing in college, and while most of my classes focused on poetry, the itch for stories never left. I was just as confused and scared by the self-publishing maze as anyone else. I won't lie and say it is easy, but it is definitely easier than you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="editing-beta-readers-sensitivity-reading"&gt;Editing, Beta Readers, Sensitivity Reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have written the last word. You've done it, you've written a book. First, take a second to congratulate yourself. Celebrate with a cookie, or chocolate, or cake, or a milkshake, or fries and a hamburger - anyway you celebrate big achievements, do that now! Scream or jump or pump your fists. You have reached a goal and you should be proud of that. Regardless of how you approach the rest of this process, know that you should be proud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend, before we get into the various types of editing and reading, that you take at least a week off from working on your manuscript. Set it down and do not touch it for as long as you can. Some people take a week, some people take a month. Find something else that recharges and energizes you. For me, that was a month away to play &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;. Wow, was it worth it. I actually took a week off of work, too, to play at the launch of the expansion. Having this time away from my manuscript and work allowed me to come back to the manuscript with fresh eyes, while also allowing me to liberate Doma and Ala Mhigo from the clutches of the Garlean Empire and make tons of amazing friends along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began doing my own set of edits. I would definitely say you should do at least on round of self editing before you hand it off to anyone else. I found typos, inconsistencies, bad grammar, bad punctuation, and a ton more. When I finished my manuscript in June I had 52,000 words. I did not want this story to be more than 45,000 words. After coming back from my time away, I was able to easily find places where repetition was hampering the pace. I was able to cut the story down to 45,000. Long rambling passages that did not serve the plot were cut. The first 2,000 words of the story were actually cut. The original words I had written back in January were gone. Go into this first round with a very critical eye. Do not be afraid to slash out entire paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, now what? Now comes the process of making your work even better. There's a lot of steps between now and hitting publish, and many of them can be done simultaneously or in many different orders. It is up to you how you want to order the next few steps - there is no universal order you must follow. Whatever you think will work best for you and your work flow is what you should follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sensitivity-readers"&gt;Sensitivity Readers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity readers are people who are aware of what tropes, stereotypes, and pitfalls characters might fall into from a certain background. If you are not queer, and one of your characters is queer, you might want to find someone who is queer to point out where you might accidentally be writing into a bad stereotype. The example I gave in the first part of this series, "Bury You Gays," would be an example. This is usually a paid service. &lt;a href="http://writeinthemargins.org/sensitivity-readers/"&gt;Writing in the Margins&lt;/a&gt; has a large database of people who are willing to do sensitivity readings and for what groups they can read for. It would be a good to find these people when you finish your manuscript so you can book them for the time that will work best for both of you. Rates for these services can vary from a system of cost per word or cost per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not have the money up front to pay these services. Some of them will do skill exchanges (I will, for example). You ask them to read for you and in exchange you can do some art for them, or provide some code for their website, or be a sensitivity reader for them later on. Some of them might offer payment plans. But I absolutely need to stress that this is work. They will point out harmful tropes and write an edit letter explaining what they liked and didn't like. When I do sensitivity reading, I use comments to point out passages or phrases that don't quite work. Some others might compile a document with those quotes, page numbers, and why the didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a sensitivity reader is not a 100% guarantee that your work will be free of harmful tropes. No two queer people have the exact same experiences, what one reader might view as fine, another can point out ways in which it is harmful. For example, there are queer people who did not end up homeless after coming out, and there are many who did. If you ask someone who had a loving and supportive family to do a read for a novel where the queer character ends up homeless, you might not be getting the best gauge on if you are using harmful tropes. When you ask a reader, include a little bit of detail or background so they can get a better sense on if they would be best. Sometimes they might even provide you a recommendation for someone who would be better suited. Most sensitivity readers will ask that you not use their name as a shield if someone finds your work hurtful. In this event, apologize and strive to do better in the future. You might ask, on your end, that the sensitivity reader not talk about the details of your book until it comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people will have sensitivity readers early on in the process, after the first self-edit. This way if things need to be structurally changed to avoid a harmful trope, those changes can be made before anyone else sees the work. It can be difficult to have to change tracks after you've had everyone else give input. Some people want to do this last, as they want the story to be in as final a state as it can be so they are only making small tweaks. Some people do it somewhere in between. Do whatever you feel is best for your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="beta-readers"&gt;Beta Readers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta readers are people commenting on the overall arch of your work. They give feedback like "this part confused me" or "I don't know if I quite got what was going on here" or "this pulled me out of the story." They are not editors and their comments will probably be more sparse. These are usually people you know personally but trust to not sugarcoat. Friends, family, and people in your writing group are usually beta readers.They give you a glimpse into how a reader might respond to your story. If you have written a tear-jerking scene and they get to it and are laughing, you know there is a disconnect between what you intended and what readers read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will want to try to explain to them the parts that they misunderstood. Don't. Do not try to explain to them what they didn't get. You won't be able to do that for a regular reader. Instead, tweak what you have written. Take a good look and try to figure out what got lost between your head and the keyboard. Ask them questions - "why did you find this funny?" - and take that feedback with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta Readers can sometimes fill in the shoes of sensitivity readers. If one of your beta readers shares a marginalization with one of your characters, they can point out harmful bits, but do not expect them to provide the kind of thoroughness of a proper sensitivity reader. If you do beta reading before sensitivity reading, you might be able to make quick fixes to be on the right track when you send it to a sensitivity reader. Likewise, if you do a sensitivity read first, a beta reader might be able to affirm that you did the work to get your characters out of bad tropes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should compensate your beta readers in some capacity. Friends and family might be willing to do it for free, but offer them a small gift card or offer to take them out to dinner. There are professional beta readers - people who you do not know who list their services on freelancing sites. It might be useful to employ at least one of these people to get parallax between what friends and family are saying. Useful, but not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="editing"&gt;Editing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room. The large, and sometimes expensive, elephant. Resist the urge to say "I do not think I need one, I was an English major/minor." Resist the urge to say "the edits I did myself are good enough." Both are false. You absolutely need an editor. There are mistakes that you will not be able to see because you wrote it. Mistakes that your brain slides over because it knows what you meant and will substitute in your intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does an editor do? It depends. There are several different kinds of editors. I highly recommend reading &lt;a href="http://www.clearingblocksediting.com/what-type-of-editing-do-you-need/"&gt;this article on the kinds of editing&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/clearing_blocks"&gt;Jen Anderson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.clearingblocksediting.com/"&gt;Clearing Blocks Editing&lt;/a&gt;. The long and the short is that there are copy edits, line edits (sometimes called developmental editing), and proof reading. Some editors will offer all three for one price, others excel at one or two and can refer out for the others. As someone who is self-publishing, I get that this looks expensive. Figure out which of those you are pretty good at yourself, and hire someone to do at least one of the others. If you have the cash, hire someone to do all three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will want to start booking this in advance. Many editors book up months in advance. I reached out to Jen in the early spring for a slot in August. Like beta reading and sensitivity reading, it is ok to book this before you have your manuscript done, so long as you know you will finish it in time. Any good editor will before a sample edit for you for free. You want to take a few pages of your roughest work and send it to them. Fight the urge to send them your best pages, you want them to get an honest look at your work and be able to gauge accurately how long it will take them. You also want to see what the best they can do is. Take that sample edit and check the comments and changes against what you are intending. If you do not think the editor will help you keep your voice and your vision, do not book them. I felt that Jen Anderson understood what I was trying to achieve, and she had a shared goal of making sure my work and writing were the best they could be for that vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could take anywhere from a week to two months for an editor to go through the whole manuscript. It all depends on how long your work is, if the editor has a day job, and how much improvement your manuscript needs. The editor should be able to give you an estimate of how long it will take and how much it will cost after completing the sample edit and you disclosing what you think the word count will be when you turn it in to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost can be anywhere from $75 to over $1000. This depends on how good your manuscript is when you hand it over, how long it is, and how long it will take the editor to complete it. Many editors will ask for a deposit when you first book, and the rest of the fee will be invoiced after the edited manuscript is sent back to you. This is probably not a place that you can bargain or skill trade. Some editors, however, will do discounts if you are a marginalized writer. Many editors will also offer discounted prices for repeat clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that you might not have a huge amount of money pour into this upfront. But bad reviews are even more costly. Amazon reviewers, generally speaking, will only tolerate a few typos before leaving a one star review. No matter how stellar your later works are, readers will find those old reviews from the days you hastily posted an un-edited manuscript online. Not having your first work professionally edited can sabotage your sales for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People might want to do this edit first, before they send it to readers so that the readers will be able to focus just on the experience, rather than being pulled out of the story by a typo or a clumsy sentence. Some people might want to do it last so that there are no big changes that might introduce new paragraphs or changes in plot after being pointed out by readers. Know your strengths and weakness and figure out the order that works best for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting all of these moving parts to line up can be a challenge. I've been a beta reader where the author sends the same google doc link to ten beta readers, and asks that we all leave comments. This author gave the option of leaving comments anonymously or under our google account. This meant that the author did not have to deal with ten different sets of comments in separate documents. Something like this might work well for you for beta readers or sensitivity readers. For working with editors, if you are working with more than one, to not do them synchronously. Send it to one editor, make changes, send to the next. Find some sort of versioning system so you can keep track of which file is which.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have all the comments from all the different readers back, and you have integrated their suggestions, it's time to start compiling a finished draft for publication. I will discuss how to set up on KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing), including formatting, ISBN questions, and questions about cover art in the next instalment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ping me on &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/DaxAeterna"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions about any of the steps outlined here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first part of a multi-part series on self publishing. This series will cover: writing, editing, beta reading, sensitivity reading, setting up a pre-order, using Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle Select, NetGalley and other means of getting reviews, and marketing. &lt;a href="http://daxmurray.com/blog/self-publishing-part-two-editing/"&gt;Read part two on editing, beta readers and sensitivity readers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://daxmurray.com/blog/setting-up-a-kindle-preorder/"&gt;part three on setting up a kindle pre-order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people have asked me several questions on self publishing on Kindle. I've talked to people who want to publish small technical books that, for one reason or another, O'Reilly doesn't want to publish. I've talked to fiction writers who want to publish a novel.

&lt;p&gt;I made a small power point last April to share at a technical conference with other Rails devs who have small or niche book ideas. I am going to heavily self plagarize from that for this post. So if some of my cat photos look familiar to you, that's why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been writing stories since I was five. My first one went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There once was a cat. The cat loved to eat. The cat loved to nap. The cat loved her human. Her human went to school sometimes. That made the cat sad. But the human always came home. The end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure my mother still has the bare book complete with hand drawn illustrations somewhere. I actually minored in creative writing in college, and while most of my classes focused on poetry, the itch for stories never left. I was just as confused and scared by the self-publishing maze as anyone else. I won't lie and say it is easy, but it is definitely easier than you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="part-one-writing"&gt;Part One: Writing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing is the hardest part. I am not going to tell you anything about needing to write everyday, or holding yourself to some arbitrary word count. You are not Stephen King or JK Rowling, and you still have a day job or daytime responsibilities that aren't writing, be it child care, elder care, or any other sort of obligation that might prevent you from writing full time. You have responsibilities, and writing is currently a hobby you want to take further. You know your health, you know your levels of ability. If you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to tell yourself to write every day, or hit some word count, that is up to you. But it is not &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set reasonable goals. When you first start, you will probably get a rush of words out, and feel that you can keep that pace going. Maybe you can, but do not get down on yourself if you can't. Do what is sustainable. Take the number of words or the time you spent at the get go and cut that in half. Try to make an effort to write when you are feeling good. Keep a notepad handy, or an app on your phone that you can sync, and jot down ideas as you have them. If you can't write words, let yourself count those notes as progress. Because they are progress. Eventually, as you hire an editor or enlist beta readers, you will need to set a deadline. Take a look at your calendar, see when you will have big obligations at work, or with your family, and try to be realistic about how much you will honestly get done during those weeks or months. The more you write, the better you will get at recognizing your pace and figuring out when you might be more productive than not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a common phrase around writing a novel, and it is "pants v plan." There are some people who sit down and start writing from the first chapter and keep going until they hit 'the end.' This is called 'pantsing.' You write by the seat of your pants, your plot twists and characters and arcs made up on the fly. This approach usually involves a ton of editing afterward, as changes you made along the way don't align with how you started it. The 'planning' approach usually invovles character profiles, a timeline, an outline, a page or two on major themes. It might involve going on google image search and trying to find photos of people who might look like what your characters look like. These character profiles can include detailed backstories, a list of their wants, their birthday, their eye color, their sun sign - any details that is pertinent or relevant to the story (and even some that are not) can be gathered in these documents. There might be setting write ups, descriptions about what a city looks like and what defines it and the people that live there. There might even be hand drawn maps. Time lines can have dates or a length of time to describe the chronology of several different characters. This detailed planning can take a lot of time and effort. People whotake this approach often do not have a lot of developmental editing to do afterward, but a huge chunk of time is spent before actually writing a single word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fall somewhere in the middle. I have a general outline, a few sentences on each character, and a rough write up of the major settings. But I tweak and change these on the fly and often end up with an ending that is different than what I thought I would have. Some authors have stories they pants and others they planned. You do not have to pick an approach and use that approach 100% correctly 100% of the time. You can do as much planning or pantsing as you think you need. It's ok to have the story change as you write it, it's ok to re-write major parts of your novel later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some great software programs out there to help both pantser and planners and those in-between. For years the go-to was &lt;a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview"&gt;Scrivener&lt;/a&gt;. It has mobile apps now for Apple products, but not for Windows or Android yet. &lt;a href="http://storyist.com/"&gt;Storyist&lt;/a&gt; also as robust multi-device capabilities. Both of these have amazing tools to help you keep track of what you are doing. There are built in folders for character profiles and location write ups, and an amazing feature that lets you see your chapters at a glance. I highly recommend watching the tutorials for how to use these tools, as there are a ton of small features that can really let you focus on writing. Scrivener has a 30 day free trial - which is counted chronologically. If you use it for an hour, it counts it as an hour and you have 719 hours left in your trial. The next day, you use it for an hour, and now you have 718 hours left in your trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not have to use a robust tool like Scrivener or Storyist, though. You can use Microsoft Word, Open Office Word, Google Docs, or Evernote. You can use Notepad or another text editor like Sublime or Atom. You can organize a folder on your desktop with a file for each chapter, and a file for each character profile. You can do the same in a Google Drive folder. I wrote "The Resignation Letter" and "A Lake of Feathers and Moonbeams" in Google Drive. Each draft had its own file. I am writing my next novel in Scrivener. I've used Scrivener for past NaNoWriMo's. I used an open source story editor, whose name I cannot recall right now, back in college for my senior thesis (ask me about international law, belligerent occupation, Hawai'i, and the difference between the Hawai'ian Indigenous Movement and the Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement, I promise not to bore you). It does not matter how you write. It might be worthwhile to try out several different tools or methods. Find one that you like, that you feel productive in, that you feel allows you to focus on the story, and use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tools you definitely want to have on hand are a thesaurus, a dictionary, and a style guide. You can use online ones or physical ones. I find the thesaurus to be invaluable. Ever since I got a concussion in 2016, I have had aphasia. The thesaurus lets me find the words that used to come so easily. I have a dozen different style guides from my time as a creative writing major, and some really amazing writing books ("&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2Bjp1Ov"&gt;The Book of Other People&lt;/a&gt;" is one of my favorites). I have a ton of books on poetry ("&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2zy4sR9"&gt;Structure and Surprise&lt;/a&gt;" is one of my favorites), and a few on writing non-fiction, too. You do not have to own a dozen books on writing to be a good writer, but it certainly helps. Many libraries have these books, and some of them even have them as digital ebooks you can borrow. In truth, any book you read is going to help you be a better writer. If you are writing sci-fi, read other sci-fi books. Read the good ones and highlight phrases you liked and write down plot twists you enjoyed. Read the bad ones and highlight what you think makes it so bad. Look at the Goodreads nominations in the genre or type of writing you are doing and try to read three or four of them. These are books your library most certainly has! Try to read diversely. Yes, Stephen King is amazingly successful at horror, but he has a style that is constant through all his books. Try to find some smaller names in horror, from all over the world, with a whole slew of different experiences and writing styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another resource, and I am not at all sorry for sending you down a rabbit hole, is &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org"&gt;TVTropes&lt;/a&gt;. This is a huge wiki of commonly used tropes. You're going to use tropes. Tropes are short cuts. But you want to know how other people are using them or inverting them. Find a book that you like and find it's entry on TVTropes. Read about how it is or isn't playing into tropes. Some tropes are done to death, some have been inverted to hell and back. If your story contains one, look at the other media that uses it and figure out how &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; particular instance of trope was made unique. Some tropes are incredibly harmful. The "Bury Your Gays" trope, for instance, has been widely critiqued and criticized. If you don't know what it is, it is a trope wherein no gay or lesbian couple survives the book / tv show / movie in tact, as one of them will die tragically. You might want to re-examine if your story can be done without falling into this trope. You do not want to end up on a list of "500 stories where the lesbian dies and the one single story where she doesn't." Most tropes, in and of themselves, are not &lt;em&gt;bad writing&lt;/em&gt;. It is how you use them that can be critiqued. I dare you to find a IP on TvTropes that doesn't have at least 100 entries of tropes it uses. I'd say "I'll wait," but I have plans for what I want to do between now and the heat death of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of other writing resources out there, and I encourage you to read as many of them as you can. Next time, I will dig into editing, beta reading, and sensitivity reading and how and when you should and how to find people to do them.&lt;/p&gt;
