            <p>Today's Question That Bothered Me a LOT While Getting Into Coding: I'm Too Cool for Mac's/I Like Being Able to Play A Lot Of Video Games on My Computer/I Work For A Nonprofit And My Cats Have Expensive Tastes, So Really, What I'm Trying To Say Is I Can't Afford a Mac, Please Tell Me They Aren't Required?</p>

<p>The answer, I learned, is that they aren't!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Traditionally, I learned, Ruby doesn't run well on Windows. Also, Window's is a different kind of operating system from what Mac's run on. Mac's run on POSIX compliant OS's. Windows is not POSIX compliant. POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface [for Unix]) is a set of standards about how operating systems run. HOWEVER, as I happily learned, Linux operating systems (most of them, anyways) ARE POSIX-ish! I happened to have a very small netbook I bought to do study abroad with, it was cheap, as I learned, because it came with Ubuntu (a linux OS), and Ubuntu is free. I had to quickly teach myself the very basics of owning a linux computer. Not enough to program with, but enough to figure out how to install open office (I had no clue what sudo apt-get install OpenOffice <em>meant</em>, just that the tutorial online told me this was how I get it. So I did it). So I was already familiar with Linux, and knew that I could partition a device to run two operating systems, and hey, Ubuntu is <em>free. </em>I also learned that you can find some pretty nice Chromebooks for relatively reasonable prices if you look at sites that sell recertified/refurbished Chromebooks. So I picked up a Samsung Chromebook and used this guide to get Ubunutu onto it.</p>

<p>I then command line installed <a href="https://rvm.io/">Ruby Version Manager</a>, Rails, and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and POOF. I had a computer that could do some development things for less than $200 and without putting my cats out of their top notch cat nip.</p>
