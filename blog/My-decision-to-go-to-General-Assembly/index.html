            <p>My decision to attend a non-accredited school to learn more about coding is many faceted. I looked at a lot of coding schools, and I looked at how long they lasted, what the hours were, how much they cost and did I have to relocate to attend.</p>

<p>I suppose I could break this down to a.) why I chose to go to a devboot-camp-esque school to continue my learning and b.) why I chose General Assembly specifically.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>To answer why I chose to go to a school, broadly speaking has a lot to do with <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/you-say-you-want-diversity-but-we-cant-even-get-internships">this Model View Culture article</a>.</p>

<p>In the article, Anna states how she is going to a job fair, looking for an internship.</p>
<blockquote>But when I asked about internship opportunities, the company representatives said no right away, or, assuming I was a CS student, asked me “What year are you?”<strong> When I told them I was self-taught, I was out</strong>. Other companies just wanted me to sign up for their newsletters, just a cheap marketing strategy, or a way of being nice. People weren’t interested in reading my CV. Out of thirty copies I had printed out, I gave out two. Some people advised me straight away to try “one of those programs designed for women.” They didn’t even listen to me. They saw that I was a woman, a beginner, looking for an opportunity to learn, and clearly not someone they would want to hire.</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>

<p>She goes on to say</p>
<blockquote><strong>Being self-taught is accepted and even highly respected when you’re a white male. If you are a woman or belong to other underrepresented groups, it’s totally different.</strong> Besides being experienced you need to have a blog, website, GitHub account and contribute to open source. A recruiter once told me that if a candidate doesn’t have all of those things, they wonder whether that person is <i>really</i> willing to learn. That statement made me angry – who came up with these requirements? And who benefits from them?</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>

<p>So, if I was not going to be respected as a self-taught coder, what could I do about it? It's a situation that a lot of white cis straight men do not have to think about. A lot of them I've encountered online have boasted of quitting their job to learn code at home full time. I've often wondered how they afford that. I certainly cannot. I have a full time job, and it pays the bills. My savings could not support me while I take a year off.</p>

<p>As stated, I can't quit my day job, so that left getting (another) bachelors out of the question. I already did that college thing, I'm not in any hurray to do it again - the food just wasn't that good. So I could do one of those boot camps, maybe? I found a free one in NYC, that even offered a small grant for living expenses, but it would involve moving, and possibly finding a place that allowed cats (cats are important!) and figuring out a lot of logistics that seemed very impossible to me. Then I was looking at the Big Names, and all the 12 week immersives were $11,000 - $15,000. I already did the college thing, I'm still paying loans on that. Those $$$ look very large to me. In addition, it would involve leaving my day job. Even if these schools promised help in the form of having partnerships with companies that hire fresh grads, I still needed to eat every day.</p>

<p>So one day I stumbled on General Assembly's night courses. It's a twice weekly course in Back-End Web Development, it's in the evenings after work. I will be able to keep my day job, and get the stamp of approval in a formal manner. I do not want to run into any roadblocks from people not thinking I am qualified as a result of their internal prejudice*.</p>

<p>(These biases* are often unconscious, and they do not necessarily mean you are an evil person. Having them means you are human, and currently uneducated in this area -which is ok, battling unconscious biases is not something we are taught in school, and it is a lifelong process - I am not here to bash anyone or yell at anyone - I am here to explain what I've been told about getting to be a woman in tech and why I made the educational choices I made!)</p>
