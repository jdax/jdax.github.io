            <p>[Note: possible spoilers for <em>Seraphina</em>]</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://www.uncorkedunwrapped.com/">Liz</a> has been recommending _Seraphina _by Rachel Hartman for some time now, and it’s just been sitting on my kindle waiting to be read. So I decided to make it the first book of 2015! For those who don’t want spoilers, I will say that I didn’t feel it lived up to the hype, or its own potential.  The start of the book had some nice world building, there were themes brought up that I thought would be touched on later in the novel, but these never showed up again.</p>

<p>The basically {SPOILERS} plot of the novel is that the world was beset by dragons, and after a long war, the dragons and humans came to an unsteady peace. The humans religion is distrustful of dragons, and see’s the dragons, and copulating with them, sinful. Dragons seek wisdom, and to be logical and reasonable, without emotion. Much like the Vulcans. The book starts, literally, with the birth of Seraphina. She brings up that she was assigned two patron saints, one without a head, and one a heretic. The first chapter spends a bit of time discussing these two saints, but they are, unfortunately, never touched on again. I felt let down, as by the time I had finished the book I’d forgotten all about them. As I was skimming through the book afterward to find some examples for this review I stumbled back upon them.</p>

<p>Soon after Seraphina is born her mother, of course, dies. We learn her mother was a dragon. In this world, dragons can disguise themselves as humans. There are usually tell-tale signs, however, that they are not. And in case there weren’t, dragons wear bells. Frequently the word “passing” was brought up regarding a dragon being able to look human enough to fool people. The connotation I most associate with “passing” is a trans persons ability to “pass” as a cis person, or for them to not be mistaken as the gender that they are not. Here it was employed by most humans as deceptive, or dishonest. While the protagonist, being half-dragon herself, clearly is not prejudiced or biased against dragons, the rest of the human world usually is. Furthermore, it very much felt that the dragon/human divide was meant to be an allegory for racism. This mixing of words, in my head, of racial prejudice and transphobia took me out of the story.</p>

<p>As part-dragon, Seraphina has scales. But she also has visions that are, at first, uncontrollable. The way it was described it the book, to me I understood it as the visions were accompanied by seizures. Seraphina then spends a lot of time making a mental garden and the ‘characters’ from her visions are attached to certain parts of her garden. This sounded to me a lot like a way one might attempt to control panic attacks or other manifestations of mental illness. At first I was thinking that this was a heroine with a disability, with a mental illness, and this was how she coped with it. But as it turns out, this is because the characters in her visions are all other half-dragons, and the visions were her spying on them in a way. So it wasn’t a disability, it was a super power. One she must, at the end of the novel, use to locate the rest of the people like her in order to hopefully stop a war. This disappointed me.</p>

<p>Seraphina has two of the best friends in the world. They happen to both be of the royal bloodline, and also engaged to each other. Because this is YA, she must obviously fall in love with one of them. This will obviously need to be kept secret from the other. She will obviously fight against this crush until she cannot anymore, and the one she loves will obviously love her back.</p>

<p>She, obviously, fell in love with the man. This, obviously, disappointed me.</p>

<p>All in all, I would say <em>Seraphina</em> is a straightforward ‘save the world as the Chosen One’ YA fantasy, I didn’t find in it anything groundbreaking. It tried, I felt, too hard and failed to be ground-breaking in area’s. The Completely Different Species as a Stand In for Racism never works, and it certainly doesn’t work when you make the other species shape-shifters. It really does not work when you borrow words from other social justice struggles and try to use them to describe your fantasy social justice struggles.</p>
