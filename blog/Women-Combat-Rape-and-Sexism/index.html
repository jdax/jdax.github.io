            <div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">

Whenever you are dealing with a candidate who has written extensively on how women are ruining the country, you can expect some outrageous comments. Recently, Rick Santorum, who wrote a book (<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/02/santorum-blames-wife-anti-working-woman-book-passage/48616/" target="_blank">now he is saying he didn't write it</a>) on how women being outside of the home is ruining America, is now taking aim at our servicewomen.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<div style="text-align:left;">After an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/09/military-women_n_1266038.html" target="_blank">announcement</a> that the Pentagon was going to start allowing women to serve closer to the front lines. The new rules are being sent to Congress, and if Congress does not reject them after 30 days, they will go into effect.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"><!--more--></div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Rick Santorum, thank goodness he is not in Congress, does not think that women are up to the task. He seems to think that women's emotions [later he said that he actually meant to talk about men's emotions] could get in the way of the mission.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">"I want to create every opportunity for women to be able to serve this country, and they do so in an amazing and wonderful way and they're a great addition -- and they have been for a long time -- to the armed services of our country. But I do have concerns about women in front-line combat, I think that could be a very compromising situation, where people naturally may do things that may not be in the interest of the mission, because of other types of emotions that are involved  It already happens, of course, with the camaraderie of men in combat, but I think it would be even more unique if women were in combat, and I think that's probably not in the best interest of men, women or the mission."</div></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:left;">While reading this, I totally think he was talking about women, it is pretty clear. But now he is saying he was totes talking about men having all those evil emotions:</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">"[I meant] exactly what I said. When you have men and women together in combat, I think there's -- men have emotions when you see a woman in harm's way. I think it's something that's natural, that's very much in our culture to be protective, and that was my concern."</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"> So, because I am overly paternalistic, and think women are weak and just need to stay home, for their own safety, obviously men in the military think exactly the same way and will compromise the mission to save a poor fragile woman. C'mon, the women in the military are tough as nails, and I don't think any of the men who see them are thinking "I need to save her." They are more likely thinking "I need to rape her."</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">When Santorum was asked if he was also making a commentary on women being too emotional for the military, he backtracked again:</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">"I've never raised that as a concern. No, the issue is -- and certainly one that has been talked about for a long, long time -- is how men would react to seeing women in harm's way, or potentially being injured or in a vulnerable position, and not being concerned about accomplishing the mission."</blockquote>
Women have been serving in the positions that are about to be opened up on a non-official level for some time, now, and it has not effected our current wars. In the 1970's women couldn't be stationed in a base in North Dakota because it was "too cold" (even though civilian women lived in North Dakota just fine, kthx.) Today, 15% of active duty soldiers are women, with 99% of Air Force jobs being opened to women, and  69% of Army jobs.

</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Many women, including Representative Loretta Sanchez, do not believe these adjustments go far enough, and believe that true combat equality must be achieved. Being in active combat is often necessary for advancement, promotions and bonuses. If women are left out of combat, they are often overlooked for those opportunities, making it more difficult for women to achieve higher positions.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Anu Bhagwati, executive director of the Service Women's Action Network, and former Marine Corps captain, found the rules "extremely disappointing" in that the ban on women in the infantry would continue:</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">"To continue such a ban is to ignore the talents and leadership that women bring to the military, and it further penalizes servicewomen by denying them the opportunity for future promotions and assignments that are primarily given to personnel from combat arms specialties."</div></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:left;">Fox Correspondent, Liz Trotta, decided this weekend that she <a href="http://motherjones.com/mojo/2012/02/fox-pundit-women-military-should-expect-get-raped-video" target="_blank">also needed to add her two cent's</a> to Santorums comments, and further criticized feminists not just for wanting women in war, but for also complaining that women in uniform get raped. A recent DOD report has found that women in the armed services are being raped and sexually assaulted, and that has increased by 64% in the last few years.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Trotta all but said that women who sign up for the military should expect to get raped. Ya see ladies, right here, it's in the job description. Just sign on the dotted line, and we can get started!</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">She also all but suggested that our uniformed men are just giant lumbering beasts who really can't control themselves, so what do we expect? Of course men are just gonna rape anything with two legs and a vagina.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">Trotta is a known war-hawk, and during Vietnam, reported extensively on the ground, calling herself the first female journalist in combat. Funny, she never mentioned at the time having to fight off hordes of uniformed soldiers unable to control their manly urges.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">To wrap this all up, for the first time in his life, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell stands up for women. I know, shocking.</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">“I like Rick Santorum a lot. I just disagree with any inference he might have made that somehow women are incapable of service in the front lines and serving in combat positions.”</blockquote>
</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">McDonnell then went on to reference his daughter, a platoon leader in Iraq, “Yes, I did get emotional, but she didn’t. She got the job done.”</div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
