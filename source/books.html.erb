        <b>Too fondly have I loved these stars;<br/>
          all these galaxies we once called ours.</b>
        <br/>
        <i>A beautiful love story in verse.</i>
        <br/>
        The relationship between two goddesses is tempestuous at best.  Seya is the embodiment of a galactic creation and Tia of cosmic destruction,They create and they destroy and then they do it all over again. Seya and Mia use their divine magic to make pulsars and nebula, to set planets spinning around stars and bind a galaxy together with a central black hole.
        <br/>
        But when one of Seya's favorite stars goes missing, she blames Mia. What was once a symbiotic cycle of life and death becomes a game of broken hearts and promises betrayed. These tensions and insecurities are explored in sonnets and villanelles; the arc of their love tracked in meter and verse. These poems touch on queer love, betrayal, trust, acceptance, and forgiveness cast against a backdrop of stardust and celestial detritus.

        <b>How many half-truths could loyalty shoulder before it broke from the weight of deception on its back?</b>
        <br/>
        <i>A sweeping LGBTQ and polyamorous retelling of "Swan Lake"!</i>
        <br/>
        Strange things can be said of the forest that spans the border of two kingdoms long at war. An evil sorcerer has made it his dominion, or an elegant enchantress has claimed it as her domain and grants wishes to those who chance upon her, or maybe the forest is guarded by an ancient and wrathful spirit.
        <br/>
        But Katya calls the forest home, living a life of magic and charms with her partner Ivan. But a threat looms over their forest, some darkness and danger that Ivan swears to protect her from. Katya finds herself caught up in a web of grudges and deception spanning generations, but most dangerous of all is the beautiful princess who stumbled into their woods. A princess who sets Katyaâ€™s heart fluttering with both desire and fear.
        <br/>
        As forces rally to rescue the princess or go to war, Katya must take measure of her own powers and decide what she is willing to sacrifice. Will she retreat to the safety of what's familiar or give up everything she knows to spread her wings and fly?

    <h2><i>A short story about a brilliant mage and an insecure empress</i></h2>
    <div class="article--text" style="font-size: 24px;">
      After generations of relentless expansion, the Empress rEleanor is ready to put her family's habit for conquest behind her, content to cease her army's forward march and solidify her position as the ruler of the territories already in her possession. But these countries her fathers' conquered are eager to leave the Empire, and willing to resort to revolution <br />
      Amalthea grew up poor, her homeland destitute after being invaded and occupied. But her new status as a citizen of the sparkling empire gives her access to the Academy of Mages. And the Empress. But once there, she defies their rules and persues her own experiments with dengerous and forbidden magics. Despite this, she catches the Empress's eye, and is soon the first official Imperial Scientist. <br />
      Together, the two have the power to sow cohesion, innovation, and improve the lives of everyone in the Empire, or they could obliterate any resistance at a perilous cost.
