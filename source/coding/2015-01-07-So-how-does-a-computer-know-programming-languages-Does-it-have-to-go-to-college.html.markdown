A question that bothered me A LOT when I first started was how does a computer know programming languages? How does it learn new languages? When Ruby was made, did every person have to take their computer back to college and make it get a major in Ruby?

This question, though presented very comically, really really bothered me. The answers I got were either overly technical to the point that I thought the person explaining it was trying more to show off than actually teach me, or very much along the lines of "well, it's magic, and it really doesn't matter, as long as it works."

I like my witches and wizards doing magic, I like my computers doing something comprehensible and understandable.

I decided to embarrass myself in front of and make myself look like an idiot to my mentor. Because, really, I wasn't getting anywhere with getting the answer to this question. What was she going to do? Tell me to never code again? I was really silly for letting my pride get in the way for a long time.

Part of my learning process, small digression, is hearing it put one way, and trying to find another way to explain it and explain it back to the person teaching me in this other way.

So she explained that the computer really only knows one language, Assembly, and there are either compilers or interpreters that translate whatever language we are coding in to Assembly. So anyone who wants to invent a new language can, but they would either have to also create the interpreter or compiler, or find someone else to do it before the computer can read it.

So I explained it back like this: So the computer is an American.
