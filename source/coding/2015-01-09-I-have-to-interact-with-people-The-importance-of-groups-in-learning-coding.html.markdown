If you read my intro post, you'll know I got started at a meet up. My first meet up was with the <a href="http://railsgirls.com/dc">DC Rails Girls</a>. I now regularly attend the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/">DC RUG</a> meet ups and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Learn-Ruby-in-DC/">Learn Ruby</a> meet ups.  You can use Meetup.com to find groups in your area! Also, some cool companies host their own meet ups. If there is a company you want to work for, even if you aren't at a level you feel is good enough, email them to ask if they have regular happy hours or meet ups for those wanting to get into the tech world.

These meet-ups have been super useful for asking questions, getting answers, and in general finding my feet in the coding world. I've had a lot of problems with not feeling like I'm learning enough, learning fast enough, etc (and aka imposter syndrome). For the most part these meet ups have shown me that everyone is still learning, and that no matter the level you are at, there is still more to learn.

For those wanting to know: yes, I've run into some assholes who've attended more to show off than learn. I suppose you run into that in any group of people (I know my college was full of them).  If you're just getting into code, especially if you are a woman, I highly recommend going to a meet up! Or a few! Or a lot! If you are nervous about it, find a friend to go with you. As tutorials become outdated, or new features come up, having someone to explain why your code won't execute is really helpful when google is not being so. Some of the people at the meet ups I go to are learning Ruby, but have several years of experience in other languages; some are like me and just getting started. Almost all of them are willing to answer what my questions!
