Hello -

I hope y’all had a good holiday and are no longer hungover from new year celebrations! I wanted to let you all know that there might be some new content here. I’ve taken a small detour into coding and web development, and want to document this journey in this space. All my reproductive rights/justice and feminism content will now be found under the “feminism” category, and all my coding content can be found under the “coding” category. Use the navigation to select which ones you want to read! I hope you find that you want to read both, as I’m finding there is a lot of cool topics to talk about while coding while feminist and while feministing while tech.

Thanks!
