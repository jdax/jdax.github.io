I received an ARC copy of 'Witches and Wolves' from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

'Witches and Wolves' was a fun novella about learning to be yourself and falling in love. The story focuses on Tory, a witch who lives in the wood to get away from the city life; Tory's ex-boyfriend, a werewolf who also enjoys the seclusion of the woods; and Gee, a young woman who is new to being a werewolf. Gee is just learning how to control her wolf, and finds herself on Tory's doorstep one night. With the help of her new friends, she learns how to embrace who she is, and also finds herself falling for Tory. 

I thought this story was well paced, and the contrast between the external conflicts and the internal conflicts worked to highlight and enhance the inner struggles Gee was going through. I also appreciated that the potential love triangles were not those of most fiction today, and the bisexuality of Tory was not a point of contention for anyone. It's really refreshing to have a bisexual character who is allowed to be human, and isn't subjected to doubt or mistrust from any potential, new, or former lover. 

I enjoyed the world-building, too. I felt there was enough details to get a sense of the world without being bogged down in unnecessary backstory or long pages of history. I got enough backstory for the world to know what was relavant to the plot, and a few additional tidbits to make the world of witches, werewolves, and werewolf hunters seem real, interesting, and detailed.

Through and through, this was a romance story. There was a side plot to solidify the relationship between Gee and Tory, and I enjoyed it. My criticisms would be the length, as I thought it was a bit too short. I would have liked to have a few more intimate scenes between the two of them (not intimate in terms of sexy times, but a few more touching moments). 

Read this book if you like werewolves and witches falling in love. Don't read this book if you are a fan of the "Bury your gays" trope, and "bisexuals don't exist" tropes.
