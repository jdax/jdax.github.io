It's here! Louisa of [Juneberry Designs](https://juneberrydesign.myportfolio.com/) has finished the cover of [_A Lake of Feathers and Moonbeams_](http://amzn.to/2v1opfg), and it looks _fantastic_. I could not be happier! The novella itself has been written, and it clocked in at 52,009 words. About 7,000 more words than I wanted it to be. I did a lot of editing to get it back down to 45,117 words. Some of the cuts were hard to make but ultimately I knew the scenes I cut were slowing down the pacing. They were cute scenes! Maybe I will release them uneditted here or in a newletter one day (I would have to make a newsletter) but for now they are sitting in a folder collecting dust. I sent the editted novel to Jen of [Clearing Blocks Editing](http://www.clearingblocksediting.com/) to do some more edits! If you have not yet noticed from the link at the top, it is available for pre-order! It should be hitting your kindles at the end of October.
