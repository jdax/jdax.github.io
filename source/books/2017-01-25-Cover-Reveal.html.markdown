Isn't it _gorgeous_? [Louisa of Juneberry Designs](https://juneberrydesign.myportfolio.com/) did a fabulous job getting the look and feel of the characters, and setting up the world, too. Seriously, you should chat with Louisa if you need a cool cover for your books! Having a cover makes it feel much more exciting as the release date draws near! Today for a brief moment the book was in the top rankings on Kindle in several categories. Specifically, in the #1 spot for Kindle Store -> Kindle Short Reads -> 30 Minutes (12 - 21 pages -> LGBT.

I've also gotten an advance [review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1888708702?book_show_action=true) and I hope y'all will take the time to read and review! 

> "...all of the prose is beautifully written and overall, this is a pleasure to read."

I've got a novella in the works right now, and hope to get it published before summer (before I will officially be consummed by _Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood_). It's one of those dreaded Fairy Tale Retellings. Of course, my version is going to be full of queer people and won't be all white people. I also wanted to send a shout out to someone I forgot to mention in my last post! I wanted to thank Erin Lynn Jeffreys Hodges, who provided a lot of technical and technology related assistance, as well as cheerleading and pom pom waving! Thanks, Erin!
