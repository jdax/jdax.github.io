  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    I am currently a Software Engineer on the Engineering team at Social Driver, a super cool digital agency based out of DC. I taught myself to code at night via Treehouse and part time courses at General Assembly, as well as a number of books and online tutorials. I love meetups, and try to attend local tech meet ups as often as possible!

    I have previously done work in the reproductive health, rights, and justice communities. I've done organizing, meeting planning, fundraising and development, peer education, outreach and recruitment, sex ed, peer education, policy, specifically in the reproductive rights and abortion care fields. I spent several years as a social worker helping low-income people seeking abortion care find abortion providers in their area, and local abortion funds to help them pay for the procedure.

    I attended Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, receiving a BA in Political Science (focus area: constitutional law and women in politics), with a minor in Creative Writing (emphasis on women's writing and poetry). I've taken courses in international at Gannon University, and completed American Universities Washington Semester Program (International Law and Organizations).

    I write about the tech industry, intersectional feminism, and book reviews. I am currently building a web app to help promote authors from marginalized communities, and books that feature main characters from marginalized communities.

    I code begrudgingly on a Mac, and very lovingly on an Ubuntu machine. I love Sublime Text, but sorry, RubyMine just makes working with legacy code a breeze.

    I live and work in the DC Metro area with my three cats. I've backpacked across Ireland, and visited Geneva, Brussels, Trier, Strasbourg, and Luxembourg, with minor pit stops at Heathrow Terminal 5. (Do not make pit stops in Heathrow Terminal 5).
