(F/D I was in an abusive relationship for a year and a half.)

Content note: discussion of violence and abuse.

I can only speak to my own experiences, and I do not want to speak over anyone else. Please check out the National Domestic Violence Hotline and RAINN for resources near you.

1.) Don't tell us we should leave. We know we should. Often we do not feel it is safe to do so. Instead tell us you are there for us if we need you. You can tell us you support what ever decision we make, and can offer a couch or a shoulder.

2.) Don't tell us you don't like our partners. We see ourselves as an extension of our partner, and therefore we interpret this attack in our partner and our relationship as an attack on us.

3.) Don't tell us you dont like the way he treats us. We interpret this as an attack on our ability to be treated well. We start thinking about what we did to deserve ill treatment.
