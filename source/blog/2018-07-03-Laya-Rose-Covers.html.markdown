Recently, I asked [Laya Rose]() to illustrate and design new covers for _The Resignation Letter_ and _A Lake of Feathers and Moonbeams_. And I can honestly say the whole process was amazing!

Laya drew up a few different concepts for each, and let me pick component parts from what I liked and combine them into something beautiful. She sent me plenty of drafts at each step. Due to timezone differences, I would often wake up, check my email before even getting out of bed, and squeel loud enough to wake up my cats as I opened up a draft. I would then text these drafts to my friends and partners with "OH MY GOSH LOOK AT THIS."
