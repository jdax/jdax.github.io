_This is the second part of a multi-part series on self publishing. This series will cover: writing, editing, beta reading, sensitivity reading, setting up a pre-order, using Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle Select, NetGalley and other means of getting reviews, and marketing._

A few people have asked me several questions on self publishing on Kindle. I've talked to people who want to publish small technical books that, for one reason or another, O'Reilly doesn't want to publish. I've talked to fiction writers who want to publish a novel. I've talked to a lot of people who have thought "I wish I could..." And I want to tell you that you can.

There's a lot of steps, and they do not always have a 'correct' order. But they are achievable and you can determine what order you want them to happen in for a lot of them. There are some cart before the horse problems, but largely, writing is the first step, and hitting publish is the last. Everything between there is a malaise of interlooping and overlapping steps to make the writing publishable.

I made a small power point last April to share at a technical conference with other Rails devs who have small or niche book ideas. I am going to heavily self plagarize from that for this post. So if some of my cat photos look familiar to you, that's why.

I've been writing stories since I was five. My first one went something like this:

>>> There once was a cat. The cat loved to eat. The cat loved to nap. The cat loved her human. Her human went to school sometimes. That made the cat sad. But the human always came home. The end.

I am sure my mother still has the bare book complete with hand drawn illustrations somewhere. I actually minored in creative writing in college, and while most of my classes focused on poetry, the itch for stories never left. I was just as confused and scared by the self-publishing maze as anyone else. I won't lie and say it is easy, but it is definitely easier than you think it is. 

### Cover Art

In order to set up a successful pre-order, you will need a cover. If you are artsy and great with Photoshop, you can try to make this on your own. If you are not, you will want to hire someone. This is another place where I suggest not attempting to be frugal. Sometime in the middle of having early readers and editors, you will want to hire this cover artist. I hired [Louisa of Juneberry Design]() to make my covers. Look at an artists portfolio, see what else they have done and if you think they can execute on your vision. Look at other self published books in your genre and find covers you like. Ask the authors who they hired to do their cover. 


Once you have chosen an artist, you will want to provide this artist with at least the basic gist of the story, the tone, and the genre. Many genre's have a certain feel or style for their covers. Look at some of the bestsellers in your genre and pass those covers onto your artist, letting them know what you do and do not like about them. This can be very back and forth. The artist will probably send you early drafts or stock art and ask how you feel about it. Be honest. If the artist picks a stock art model that looks nothing like how you imagined the character, let them know. It is sometimes helpful to pass along your own images that you might have grabbed way back when you were making character profiles. They will probably not be able to use those images as they are copyrighted, but they can get a better idea of what you are going for. 

Kindle does have its own cover maker. I do not suggest using this. You want your book to look original, and Kindle only has so many stock photos. There is a saying, "do not judge a book by its cover," but no one actually follows that when it comes to books. A professional looking cover tells a reader that they can expect professional level storytelling. There are numerous examples where this was not true, and yet people still have this assumption. You will not be able to convince them otherwise. Have a professional cover.

The cost for this can be anywhere from $75 to $300, sometimes more depending on who you are hiring. It is absolutely worth every penny to have a top notch cover. There are people on Fivrr or other freelancing sites that offer these services for $5 to $10. I know this is tempting. But what you will end up with is a cover you could had your cat make by setting her on the keyboard while MS Paint is open. 

If you are truly in a rush, and you want people to be able to pre-order now, make a small cover that says "COVER COMING SOON." I am getting a little ahead of myself, but once you have your pre-order set up, you will want to get the title on Goodreads. Goodreads archives all versions of a cover except one that says "COVER COMING SOON." You do not want a cheaply made placeholder cover to be in the archives of your Goodreads listing.

### Setting up the pre-order

## Why?

I will get into the ins and outs of pre-release marketing, but the long and the short is that during your pre-release marketing, you want people to be able to pre-order. You want them to be able to click that button while they are thinking about it. They will not remember to check back on release day to get it. Having a ton of pre-orders in will also help your ranks. If you start off with a ton of buys on release day, your book may make it to the top of the pages in Amazon. 

## How?

You will want your banking information, a version of your manuscript (does not have to be final), and your cover. Amazon will let indie authors set up pre-orders up to 90 days in advance of release and at least 10 days ahead of release. There might be a temptation to have a shorter pre-order window, but you will want those full three months for reasons I will get to later on.
