_This is the second part of a multi-part series on self publishing. This series will cover: writing, editing, beta reading, sensitivity reading, setting up a pre-order, using Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle Select, NetGalley and other means of getting reviews, and marketing._

A few people have asked me several questions on self publishing on Kindle. I've talked to people who want to publish small technical books that, for one reason or another, O'Reilly doesn't want to publish. I've talked to fiction writers who want to publish a novel. I've talked to a lot of people who have thought "I wish I could..." And I want to tell you that you can.

There's a lot of steps, and they do not always have a 'correct' order. But they are achievable and you can determine what order you want them to happen in for a lot of them. There are some cart before the horse problems, but largely, writing is the first step, and hitting publish is the last. Everything between there is a malaise of interlooping and overlapping steps to make the writing publishable.

I made a small power point last April to share at a technical conference with other Rails devs who have small or niche book ideas. I am going to heavily self plagarize from that for this post. So if some of my cat photos look familiar to you, that's why.

I've been writing stories since I was five. My first one went something like this:

>>> There once was a cat. The cat loved to eat. The cat loved to nap. The cat loved her human. Her human went to school sometimes. That made the cat sad. But the human always came home. The end.

I am sure my mother still has the bare book complete with hand drawn illustrations somewhere. I actually minored in creative writing in college, and while most of my classes focused on poetry, the itch for stories never left. I was just as confused and scared by the self-publishing maze as anyone else. I won't lie and say it is easy, but it is definitely easier than you think it is. 

### An Author Website && Newsletter

I made a lot of mistakes with this. I had one website and I kept all of my professional doings on it. I had my writings from when I was a professional abortion care worker, I had my writings on my journey to learning Ruby, and I had my own book reviews. I still have an overly long bio with two paragraphs on the programming languages I know and have experience in. I really need to cut out a lot of that and get it moved to my professional site just for my coding. And for some reason I have a ton of writings on this blog about my snakes. You want your website to be focused on your skills as an author and promoting your books. Don't be like me. 

Find a blogging platform that works well for you. There are tons of places that offer free blog hosting. Wordpress, Squarespace, Blogger, and more. They have great interfaces that let you log in and blog. Many of them will offer you a custom domain name if you buy one. Wordpress lets you purchase that domain name right in the app and have it apply over the firstnamelastname.wordpress.com. I suggest trying to get a "firstnamelastname.com" domain name, these are usually around $10 - $40/year. Don't be afraid to try other combinations if your desired domain name is taken already. You can purchase a custom theme, too, so that your site looks unique. You can purchase this on Wordpresses theme market place or hire someone to make you something completely new.

I used a wordpress.com account for awhile, and then I decided to code my own wordpress site and host it on my own, too. I did that via wordpress.org. I did this because I was tired of seeing the 'powered by wordpress' at the bottom of my wordpress.com site and I was learning more php at the time. And then I moved my blog to a middleman site, which is a static site generator powered by the Ruby programming language. I do not suggest this route if you are not interested in coding. It is pretty easy to set up a wordpress.org site if you really do not wan 'powered by wordpress' at the bottom. But there is no stigma against that in the publishing world. There is in the software engineernig realm, and since this blog was also once a showcase of my tech chops, well. Don't be like me.

On your site you definitely want to be updating at least once a month. These updates can be tidbits of things you learned while researching, or updates on how the writing process is going. They can be updates on what books you have read and what you thought of them. If you are going to WorldConf or ReaderConf or other book conferences, write about your experiences there. 

Make sure links to your books are prominent. You probably have noticed that I have mine sticked to the right side. Make sure you have a clear and concise bio of yourself, so anyone who wants to do a write up of you and your works can find it easily. Make sure that bio has a photo that you like with it. Have a contact form. Wordpress and other content management systems will allow you to easily have a contact form.

Some authors have exclusive newsletters - weekly or monthly updates that aren't shared on the main blog. I love "The Lexical Gap," which is ['s]() newsletter. It always has a cool bit of information on words that are in one language but not in another and how that creates confusion or tension. I am in the process of setting up a newsletter myself. I am using [buttondown](). It's simple, powerful, and lets me write custom code. I realize not all of my readers are going to be down for hand coding the headers of the newsletters, so definitely research other options. In ButtonDown, I can copy a little code and paste it into the end of an article and it does the rest for me. I then log into buttondown, write my newsletter, and hit send!

Both the purchasing of a domain and the starting of a newsletter will ask you for an address. This address will be publically available. Domain privacy will strip out your name, phone number, and email, but it will still show anyone who looks up the domain WHOIS the address. If your domain is firstnamelastname.com, they can probably guess that the address provided is yours. Newsletters are governed in the US by CANSPAM act, and it states an address must be present at the end of each and every newsletter. For an author who is agented or with a publishing house, they can use the P.O. Box of their agent or publisher for these fields instead of their own. Putting in a fake address might be alluring, but it can result in a fine of up to $16,000 dollars. I have friends who use [viabox]() for this, it's free to have the box and you just have to pay to have any items sent to the viabox to your address. This is on a per-use basis. If you don't have anything at all sent to your viabox, it's free. I am using a USPS P.O. Box for this. I got a small one, and I pay semi-annually for it, around $60 for 6 months. I was able to sign up online for the box and then I had to go into the post office proper with two forms of ID and I was given the key.

### Cover Reveals

Book bloggers love hosting exclusive content. It gets the site traffic, and hopefully many of the people visiting for the exclusive content will stick around for the regular content or subscribe to an RSS feed. Figure out some best sellers in your genre or niche and then google "$bookName + exclusive cover reveal" and see what website pop up. Contact these sites and ask if they would be interested in hosting an exclusive cover reveal for your book. If you are a new author and your name doesn't have the traction yet, you might get a lot of "no's." Do not be discouraged. Keep trying. If you absolutely cannot find anyone, host it yourself on your own blog. Let all your social networks know it is happening. Ask some friends to help you out and tweet excitedly about it. Make sure your pre-order is already set up and have tons of links to where they can purchase it. Gush about your cover artist.

### Early Reviews

Early reviews are fundamental to a pre-release strategy and something I totally dropped the ball on. Goodreads will let you post reviews way ahead of time. Amazon won't, but people will be cross checking Goodreads in a lot of cases. Early reviews on peoples personal review blogs can be promoted on your own social media. There are professional reviewers (people who work for the New York Times or at review houses like Kirkus) and independent reviewers. A solid pre-release marketing plan will include both.

## Independent Reviews

# NetGalley

NetGalley is one of the largest sites for ebook arcs. I have been on both sides of NetGalley. I started out as a reviewer. You create an account, explain where you will be posting the reviews (goodreads, amazon, personal blog, etc). You can then browse hundreds of yet-to-be-released books and request an e-galley or e-ARC (advanced reader copy). Some publishers have it so that anyone who requests can get a copy. Others will manually approve readers and will look for reviewers with large followings or who review professionally for places like the New York Times. Once you have a copy, you read it and leave a review on the site itself. You are not required to post your review anywhere but on NetGalley, but posting your reviews elsewhere will make it that much more likely you can start requesting bigger name books. When I review, I put a disclaimer at the top of my review that says "I was provided a free advanced copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."

As an author, you can post your books on NetGalley directly, it does cost money though. As much as $700 depending on the package you get. There is a way to get a discounted listing. You can join [Independent Book Publishers Association]() for around $99/year. Once you are a member you can purchase a NetGalley package directly through IBPA. These packages are very much discounted from what you would pay NetGalley directly. In hindsight, I should have set this up a lot earlier in the process. This is what I mean by wanting the full 90 day pre-order. If you can time your NetGalley promotion with the day the pre-order starts, you can start having reviews show up on Goodreads months before it comes out. Amazon will not let you have reviews before the release date, but Goodreads reviews are gold. The IBPA package included having someone at IBPA handle the logistics of the set up. I did not have to worry about anything. I paid the money, sent a cover file and the manuscript IBPA, and they took care of the rest. IBPA has other perks, too, including a huge discount on FedEX orders, Dell orders, webinars, conferences and more. I definitely think they are worth the cost alone just for the NetGalley discount, but all the other perks are magical. 

Unfortunately, as far as NetGalley goes, I did this after the release date, so I am not seeing a huge return on investment right now. Next time, I will definitely get this set up earlier.

## Other Independent ARC's

Some book bloggers do not use NetGalley or other e-galley site like Eidleweiss, and instead want to have authors approach them. There is a great list at [IndieReview]() of book bloggers that prefer to review indie authors. It can be a tedious process, going through the list, going to the reviewers website, reading their submissions policy, and then sending the request.

I created a template that had all the criteria a review might want and I copy and paste that into the email at the start and then read the submissions requirements to see if there is anything I am missing. I always include a seperate .png of the cover for them to use on their site, and at least two versions of my book in different file formats. Usually their submission pages specifies which file types they will accept. 

I should have started doing this before release, but again, I will remember this for next time. For now I have a google spreadsheet with a column for the blog name, the writer(s) name(s), the URL, the date I sent the request and the date I heard back (some of them I haven't heard back from at all so far) and what their response was. I also have a sheet in the doc for the list of bloggers I wanted to reach out to, but who had "submissions are closed" on their submissions page so I can remember to check them next time I have a book out.
