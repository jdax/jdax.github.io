I am sorry, so sorry, that you have found your way to this page, to this article. I wish this was something that I did not have to write, and that you did not have to read. But we are both here, and forward is the only direction we can go. As of writing this, I am still going through this. I can’t promise you anything at the end of the journey.

Half my lifetime ago, in high school, I met the most important person in my life. I don’t remember the exact day, nor how it happened, but it happened and there isn’t a part of my life that isn’t better for having him in it. He is my best friend, a found-family sibling. I always told him I would do anything for him, anything at all to help him or make his life better. I never thought that this would be the way in which I would prove that.

When I found out he had cancer, I was paralyzed. I didn’t know what to do. I’d just started a new job, I’d just signed a lease on a new apartment, I’d just done so many things that required stability, steadiness. I debated, I argued with myself and with my spouse. I spent $500 on a last minute flight from DC to my hometown so that I could spend a weekend with him. During that weekend I came to understand that I was not lying to myself or him when I had made him all those promises. 

Two weeks later I quit my job. There’s more to that story, but suffice it to say I will always pick him over anyone or anything else. I have temporarily moved 600 miles away from my spouse, my cats, my home, and have been living on BFF's couch since then. I've been a live-in caregiver to him for two months now. It's a fucking hard thing to do. Going to appointments, keeping up on medication refills, cooking, cleaning, a thousand small things that need to be done. It seems impossible at times and terrifying the rest of the time. I am constantly afraid that missing one little thing, that forgetting one little thing, that not doing one little thing will cost my friend his life. I have had to do so many impossible things, so many insurmountable things, because the alternative isn't even something I want to think about.

So, for you, I have a list of things I have learned, often the hard way. Things I wish someone had told me when I decided to take on this daunting responsibility. 

**1.) Document everything.**

I have a notebook. It's spiral bound and large. I write everything in it. My system is date at the top, then vital signs when the doctors take them. The names of who we spoke to, when, and what they said. When they hung which medicine in the IV, when they took it down, who administered it, who doubled (chemo has to be documented and admin'd by two people). Results from labs. Who did the labs. Anything and everything goes in the book.

There are so many people involved in cancer care; you have to become a case manager. You have to take on the responsibility of making sure everything is communicated between doctors and nurses. IT SUCKS. But your loved one won't be able to advocate for themself most of the time, they'll be too tired. You need to have a record of your own of what happened and when and by who so that if you need to escalate things, you have a record of your own and aren't relying on what is in their system.

You want this because you will have a dozen other health care professionals wanting to know what is going on, everyone from the eye doctor to the dentist will want to know. Have this record with you at all times. 

You want this because you will forget. You will have so many things in your head, and a written record of what days you were at the infusion center, what drugs were given, which doctors promised what, will be invaluable. 

**2.) Invest in hand sanitizer.**

During chemotherapy, your loved one will have a compromised immune system and will need to be super careful. I have a bottle of hand sanitizer in ALL of my bags, in my jacket pockets, attached to keys, in the car. They are EVERYWHERE. But it's SO VITAL. I never realized how many people just cough where ever they want to cough until I started having to act as germ bodyguard for my BFF. I will sometimes just whip it out of my pocket and wave it in someone's face and ask them if they need it. They usually get the point.

CONSTANT VIGILANCE. 

I don't let my BFF open doors, touch stuff that might have germs on it, etc. I do that myself and then clean my hands with hand sanitizer.

So many people don't realize how easily a cancer patient can get sick, nor how quickly that sickness can lead to life-threatening complications. I've watched people who KNOW BFF is undergoing chemotherapy cough into their hands and then try to shake BFFs hand. I've listened as people swear they "aren't that sick" or hide that they are sick, because they wanted to see BFF. I get it, and you will, too, eventually. This is their friend / loved one, too. And they want to see them. It made me so mad at first, how could they knowingly endanger their loved one's life like this? But they don't get it, not at first. Cancer is not something many see as up close as caregivers do. If you have never been a caregiver, you may not realize how precarious the situation is. In this case, if you can't get these loving but uniformed and sick friends to leave until they are healthy, hand them a bottle of hand sanitizer and tell them to cover their cough.

**3.) Vogmasks.**

I wish I had found these earlier. Wearing a mask to prevent germs is a great compliment to the hand sanitizer. For awhile he was wearing the masks the hospital provided, which are just not attractive and are scratchy and uncomfortable. I bought him some comfortable ones that had funny faces on them but no vents so he was getting really stuffy. THEN I found vogmasks! They are CUTE and super comfortable and have HEPA and carbon vents so it doesn't get so stuffy in the mask. We haven’t gotten one yet (they are all sold out due to the California wildfires right now) but if you can snag one, do!

**4.) Things you should always have in your bag.**

A bottle of water. A granola bar. A pen. A list of their current medications. The name and phone number of their pharmacy. The name and phone number of their oncologist. A mask for them. A bottle of hand sanitizer. 

You want the water because they will get thirsty while out, or will need to take a pill. You want the granola bar in case they get hungry, or their blood sugar gets low. You will want to carry those important phone numbers and names and lists because so many doctors will need them. A mask for keeping them safe, even if they don’t think they need it that day. The hand sanitizer because you will always need it. 

There may be other things you come up with along the way, things that are your loved one's creature comforts that you will want to have for them should they need it or want it. They might want to carry their own medications, or they may ask you to keep them in your bag. I feel like Mary Poppins sometimes. BFF says he is feeling weak, I ask if he is hungry and he says yes. I reach into my bag and there is a magical granola bar just for him. 

**5.) Delegate.**

Tons of people will ask what they can do to help. TAKE THEM UP ON THIS. Even if it's just "make this meal, it's her favorite, and bring it over Tuesday." You do NOT have to do everything! Delegate outwards.

Someone you trust lives near the pharmacy? Ask them if they can occasionally pick up meds and bring them over. Even if someone can't help out directly, you can ask them to come over and hang out with her while you run errands, or see your friends (it's ok to take breaks to do stuff you need to do!), or even while you clean.


**6.) Become a secretary.**

A lot of people will want to visit, ask if they can come over, see your loved one in the hospital during chemo. Tell them not to text your loved one to arrange these visits, text YOU. You are now your loved one’s secretary. You are now responsible for scheduling all these visits. But do not be afraid to tell people "NO." 

"Oh, I'm just getting over a cold."
"No."

 "Can I bring my unvaccinated kid?"
"No."

The apartment is a mess? Tell them no! Your loved on is sleeping? Tell them no or that they can come but will have to wait! Your loved one is your priority! You may hurt the feelings of some people along the way, and this will be rough. But you need to be able to prioritize your love one's health and safety over other people's feelings.

But also say "no" for yourself! If you need a break from people, you can say no, too! You can be too tired to entertain, too busy, or just not in the mood. If you loved one does want to see someone and you don't at that particular time, see if you can find a way so that you don't have to do all the work for a visit to happen. You can schedule times so that you aren’t put out and your loved one gets to see people when they are feeling their best.

Keep a calendar, multiple calendars, with all your loved one’s appointments and keep on top of it. Color code it if you need to, something to make sure you know when everything is!

Get MediSafe app. It's an app that you can put her meds into and how often they should be taken and when and it will have reminders for meds. It's a flying-spaghetti-monster-send.


**7.) Enameled Cookware.**

A lot of chemo drugs are heavy metals. This means your loved one will probably develop a constant taste in their mouth of some sort of metal. This can make eating SO HARD. Get enameled cookware. 

The taste of metal apparently transfers from the cookware to the food, non-chemo people don't notice, but it's really apparent to people getting chemo! It can make all the difference! If you can't afford a whole set of pots and pans, see if you can pick up an enameled dutch oven, they can be used for almost everything.

**8.) Plastic Silverware.**

Like the above, the metal taste is apparent when using regular silverware, so get some plasticware and let your loved one use that. It can seem silly eating from plastic / wasteful / etc. BUT. Food will taste like FOOD and during chemo food is VERY IMPORTANT.

**9.) Cleaning.**

Chemo can stay in the human body for 72 hours. During that time it is excreted in urine, sweat, saliva, blood, etc. Chemo can be toxic to people who don't need it, and for your own safety you will need to take extra precautions. Don't share silverware / food / plates with your loved one. Do their laundry separate from your own and wear gloves. Wear gloves when doing dishes. Wear gloves when cleaning the shower / toilet / sink. Flush the toilet before you use it.

It seems tedious, and heck, you love them, so you don't care, right? Exposure to chemo can cause cancer in healthy individuals. You will notice the nurses putting on extra gloves, huge plastic gowns, wearing goggles, when hooking up the chemo IV's to your loved one. In small amounts, it's nearly nothing. But you're going to be exposed every day during their treatments. It will add up.

**10.) Take advantage of naps.**

Chemo drains the body. It's exhausting. Your loved one will nap. Take advantage of this! BFF had 8 am to 4 pm chemo 5 days in a row, every third week. He would nap for about half of this. I used this time during infusions to work, to read twitter, to read a novel, to watch cat videos on youtube. To call the pharmacy about that rx refill. To go over bills. Anything I didn't want him worrying about, I did while he napped. Anything fun for myself I wanted to do, I tried to do while he napped. When we are not at chemo, he will still nap in the middle of the day and I will use half of that time for chores and half for myself. IT IS OKAY TO DO THINGS FOR YOURSELF. I'm gonna repeat that again: IT IS OKAY TO DO THINGS FOR YOURSELF.

**11.) Get comfortable outside of your comfort zone.**

So, prior to taking on this responsibility, I had never ever cooked meat. Not once. I’ve been vegetarian since middle school. But BFF is a carnivore, and he wanted steak. So I had to learn how to prepare and cook steak. And quickly, too! When a chemo patient is hungry, it is a fleeting thing. They can be starving, and want food now, but you miss that window and it goes to nausea, and then they are asleep.

I also had not driven a car in YEARS. I HATE driving. I moved to a city with decent public transit so that I would never have to drive again. But he can't drive most of the time. So I've had to re-learn how to drive, while driving him to appointments. I think I’ve driven more in the last two months than I have in my entire life prior. It seemed so scary, so impossible, when I got behind the wheel after a particularly rough chemo day. I held the steering wheel, making sure my hands did not shake, not wanting him to see how terrified I was. But I did it. I put the car in drive and I pressed on the gas pedal and I got us home.

I don't know what "impossible things" you will encounter, what thing you never thought you could do, would do, can do. But you will find yourself needing to do something like that. And you will do it wonderfully.

**12.) Enable vs Comfort.**

Depression is going to set in at some point, and depression combined with chemotherapy and cancer treatment is going mean that there will be some days your loved one will say they want nothing to eat, doesn't want to do anything, etc. There's a fine line between telling them to do what they want and enabling unhealthy behavior. I have to skate this constantly with BFF and eating. He's nauseated, he doesn't want to eat, but he needs to eat. I try to offer him food he likes, or a protein drink: something that ensures he gets nutrients while still respecting that he doesn't feel like eating.

It’s so easy to see them in pain and want to let them do anything they want, even if they want to do nothing at all. It’s so easy to not confront them on self-sabotaging behavior or self-destructive behavior, but you have to.

**13.) AUTONOMY IS VITAL.**

There are things you will want to keep from them, things that they don’t need to know about or worry about. Things like the pharmacy being out of a med and you having to call other ones to get it in. Things like a doctors office forgetting to actually schedule an appointment they told you they scheduled. Things like Aunt Phyllis texting you to tell you that your loved one only has cancer because they take birth control. Keep those things from them, yes.

But other things? Big medical decisions? Courses of action? Let them lead. Even if they look at you and shrug. Even if they gesture to you to tell the doctors what to do. You need to let them have full control over their treatment even if they are so tired they don't want to. Protect and guard what autonomy they DO have in their day to day life.

Doctors are going to tell them not to do XYZ, or not to eat ABC. If they’re having a bad day and ABC won't kill them and they want ABC? Let them have it. Nurses after nurse has told BFF to not drink so much soda. But I don't stop him, because it makes him happy and keeps him going. They will look at me and say, in utter exasperation, "tell him not to drink so much soda!" and I just smile. If soda keeps him going, it keeps him going. Guard and protect their autonomy and agency as much as you can.

**14.) YOU ARE DOING ENOUGH.**

This is really important. You will go to bed at night and worry that you aren't doing enough. This will happen every night. You will lay awake and go over all the things you didn't do. Oh, I didn't do that last load of laundry. I had wanted to clean the bathroom today and I didn't get to. THIS IS OKAY. Things will happen! Today? Today he said baked salmon with roasted asparagus was a great dinner. So I made that! Then, he got a bad headache and nausea. I handed him his plate and he didn't want it. I asked him what he did want and he said mac n cheese. So I made mac n cheese. I had wanted to get to a dozen other things tonight, but instead I made mac n cheese and then decided I was worn out and tomorrow is an early day. THINGS HAPPEN, SHIT COMES UP. You will never ever get to the bottom of that to-do list. AND THAT IS OKAY. Make priorities. Realize priorities can change.

You can't be a good caregiver if you don't realize your limits early and often. You can't be a good caregiver if you are always worn out, burned out, exhausted. Whenever I felt the call of "I don't care what happens to me, BFF is my priority" I reminded myself, no, I did have to go to my neurologist appointment. If I didn't, who would care for BFF while I had a massive migraine? You are doing enough, and you taking time to look after your own needs is not taking away from your loved one. 

Again, I am sorry you are here. Know that you are taking on a huge responsibility, but you aren’t alone. You will go through hell, but you are not the only one who has gone through it.
