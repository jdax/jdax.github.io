Speculative fiction has always been about imagining things that seem impossible and examining those impossible things. Shelley imagined science creating life, and wondered what that life might be like, digging into the moral and ethical ramifications for all involved. We have space opera projecting our current struggles onto a galaxy and how genocide might happen if one had enough fire power to destroy an entire planet. But sometimes those things we think impossible are not, and people have been quietly or loudly living what others might deem an impossible life. And so it is with gender, where we have cis authors and film makers and artists imagining a life without gender, and here we are already doing that just fine.  

The advent of the internet made the dissemination of information cheap, easy. With it came the ability to find community. People who are genderqueer or non-binary have always existed. Humans have always had "third genders," we just haven't always talked about it. Eunuchs, for instance, were not considered to be gendered. We learn about them today as men who might have been punished, still men, though. But the actualities of life for them were that they were not men or women. Today, we might call them agender. "Two Spirit" was coined in the 1990's to be an umbrella term for the non-binary identities found throughout American Indigenous cultures and unites those who are winkte in the Lakota nations and nadleeh among the Navajo people. With the Internet, we could learn these histories and form new communities around them.

With _We Need Diverse Books_ and other amazing efforts to make publishing more inclusive, we have more options when it comes to seeing ourselves in the written word. Before that, though, we struggled to find heroes who were like us. When we did? It was a cis author believing themself to be bold and mold-breaking and really just badly explaining gender. Usually, we were aliens, evil gods, or monsters. Queering villians is popular, even still to this day, but a special kind of evil or otherness is often reserved for trans characters.

Yet this literal alienation continues even into works written in the last few years. Non-binary identities are still not-human; humans in those worlds might not blink at the three-gender aliens they are making trade deals with, but we see no non-binary humans. 

A note before I start: the list of books containing variations on gender is not exhaustive. There are many many books out there now that have non-binary characters of human and in- flavors, done both well and not. I highly suggest 


## Are We Aliens

[_The Left Hand of Darkness_ (1969) by Ursula Le Guin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423.The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness)  

 In the far future, an interstellar federation reaches out to Gethen, an ice planet that appears to have human-like life forms. Genly Ai is sent as the emissary, but discoveres that the Gethians are "ambisexual." Their bodies cycle through sexes, but spend the majority of their time as without sex. Everyone is addressed in a gender-neutral way, and Ai is appaled by this. He tries to see everyone as male all the time, and gets suspicious when someone walks in dressed femininely. The reader is not supposed to like Ai, and is supposed to see his inability to see _humans_ as a fundamental flaw. While this work was groundbreaking for the time, it is still the start of the metanarrative that genderfluid identies are _other_. It still conflates sex with gender in a lot of sections, while in others, in conflict with itself, it tries to disentangle them. I must say, I love Le Guin. This isn't my favorite of her works, though.  

[_Xenogenisis Saga_ (1987) by Octavia Butler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60926.Lilith_s_Brood)  

You cannot talk about speculative fiction without talking about Butler. If you haven't read her _Parable_ books, youk should do that right now. Seriously. I'll wait. _Xenogensis_ takes place far in the future, where somehow humanity has nearly wiped itself out. Along comes the Oankali, a race of alien beings with three distinct genders, each with their own part to play in the reproductive process. The idea of humans having more than two genders is never discussed, and the books heavily link sex and gender. Despite these shortcomings, this is a beautiful and strange trilogy about what it means to be human, and what human nature truly is and what humanity must do to survive in spite of itself.  

[_The Long Way to the Small Angry Planet_ (2014) by Becky Chambers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26042767-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet)  
 
This is a book set on a big galactic stage, but on which humans are rather unremarkable. We aren't running the show, we are not big players. One of the races in this book is the Aandrisk, a genderfluid race that, like the Gethians, cycle through a feminine, masculine, and neutral gender, the latter of which uses neo-pronouns. I am so tired of seeing male/female/neutral as the only options for genderfluidity. There's more than those, and it would nice to see that acknowledged some time. But, like all the others in this list, there is never mention that there might be agender humans, non-binary humans, genderfluid humans. Just robots and aliens grapple with gender at all in this universe.

[_Our Dark Duet_ (2017) by Victoria Schwab](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075662-our-dark-duet)  

This is the second book in a series about literally hunting monsters. The only non-binary character in the book? A monster. This character, Soro, a Sunai (a type of monster that consumes souls) is asked whether they are a male or female. They answer that they are a Sunai. Instead of giving a gender, they give the type of monster they are. There are no human non-binary characters. Once again, we are only shown as monsters, as other.

[_Leia, Princess of Alderaan_ (2017) by Claudia Gray](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34860402-leia)   

I loved this book. I spent a lot of time in high school and middle school reading the old EU books, devouring everything Timothy Zhan wrote with delight, but thoroughly hating books like "The Courtship of Princess Leia" and others that couldn't figure out who Leia _is_. Grey, though? Nailed Leia. Here and in _Bloodline_. She never outrights says Amilyn Holdo is queer, but wow did I read a lot of Leia/Amilyn subtext in the last half of this book. _Star Wars_ is an obstensibly large galaxy, but very human centric, and very cis and heterosexual. Enter the Chalhuddans. As C3PO explains to Leia, they have five genders and those genders frequently change. Their pronouns are often based on past, present, and future genders. For the save of convenience, they ask that other species use singluar 'they.' If you are not sensing a theme yet, let me just say: they are aliens and no mention of human or human-like genders beyond "man" and "woman" are ever mentioned in this book.

## Are We Gods

[_Hundred Thousand Kingdoms_ (2010)by N.K. Jemisin]()  
The start of an amazing trilogy about literal gods have very human problems with communication. A polyamorous trio of gods must handle a communication break down that results in one of them dying, one of them being imprisoned, and one of them becoming a vengeful and spiteful god seeking absolute adoration. Nahadoth, god of darkness, once was genderfluid, switching between multiple genders easily. But after Enefa's death, Itempas trapped Nahadoth in a singular, masculine form. Later in the series, Nahadoth resumes their fluidity. But no humans are ever mentioned in this world to be genderfluid or any gender but woman or man. 

[_The Seafarer's Kiss_ (2017) by Julia Ember](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32890474-the-seafarer-s-kiss) This is an Ursula origin story with vikings and taking down the patriarchy. Yes, Loki in Norse Mythology is genderfluid. But the Loki of Norse Mythology is not _evil_, just _mischievious_. Even the Marvel Loki is Chaotic Neutral and not Chaotic Evil. Here? The only trans character is a rapist, rape enabling, masochistic liar and deciever with no redeeming qualities at all. I hate it. I actually [wrote a very long post on why I hate it.](https://daxmurray.com/blog/review-the-seafarers-kiss/) Either way, the only non-binary character in the whole book is evil and it is never ever mentioned that merfolk or humans could also be genderfluid or non-binary. 

## Are We Human?

[_Seraphina / Shadow-Scale_ (2012 / ) by Rachel Hartman]()

>>> Abdo gave me the expected fish-eye, but for an unexpected reason: _Wrong gender. You use cosmic neuter for a stranger._  
I glanced at Rodya; he leaned to one side and spat on the ground. _He’s not a stranger anymore. If anyone embodied naïve masculine, surely Rodya—_  
_You use cosmic neuter for a stranger,_ Abdo insisted. _And he’s a stranger until you’ve asked, “How may I pronoun you?”_  

This exchange happens in _Shadow-Scale_, where the protagonist, Seraphina, travels to another country. This country is full of _humans_. Humans who have six distinct genders, each with their own pronoun set. There are dragons, many of them, in fact, in these books, but there are also humans who have systems of gender and pronouns and all that fun stuff! I wanted to jump for joy when I read this. It's a passing thing, something not that carries much weight in the overall plot. But it's there.
