I wanted to formally announce my forthcoming novella, due to be released this fall. It is an #ownvoices queer re-telling of *Swan Lake,* and I am really excited to share it with you when it comes out. I am going to be self-publishing this novella, just as *[The Resignation Letter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MS9NU7F)* was self-published. [Louisa](http://www.juneberrydesign.com/) will again be doing the cover for me, and I've asked Jen of [Clearing Blocks Editing](http://www.clearingblocksediting.com/) to help me out with making sure everything is PERFECT.

I've been putting together and [pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/daxaeterna/a-lake-of-feathers-and-moonlight/) for it, and I hope you'll check that out. I've also definitely got a playlist for when I am writing it, here are the [top songs](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXynmGGrclnddDFOND_5TPoYX5hx48SwXvW60gMuRVsEokrWeAkWfnFkzGrJ11XMDbIPk2LbhD65yEFC23oZ4hJrxlkuZ8Q%3D%3D) on it:

From the potential blurb:

> At the center of the forest there is a lake. On a cool night, moonbeams kissed the waters and Katya was born. Since then she has kept company with the crows and the eccentric sorcerer, Ivan, who has made his home there. She soars through the night as a swan alongside her crow sisters, and does errands for Ivan during the day. She never believed that her life would every be spent any differently, being content with her minor magics and charms and safe beside Ivan. 
     
> When a group of soldiers escorting the princess Yi Zhen from neighboring kingdom of Shān come through her woods, she is shocked to find Ivan taking the princess as his prisoner. He asks Katya to disguise herself as another captive to glean information from the princess. Thus she spends her days feigning captivity alongside a princess whom she is slowly falling for.  A princess who is betrothed to the Princen Alexis of Lebedia, who is surely searching for her.
     
> Katya finds herself entwined in a complex web of politics, grudges, betrayal and heartache spanning centuries. At the heart of this web she must find out who she is, and what she stands for, and what she is willing to sacrifice to stay true to herself.
     
> A nuanced re-telling of "Swan Lake" from the perspective of the black swan, this story explores love and loyalty, how both are won, earned, destroyed, or betrayed.
