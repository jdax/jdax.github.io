I accidentally (no, really) didn't read any works of fiction by a single man this year. Some of those books were awful/hilarious, some of them were really good. I already blogged about the absolute most irritating book I read in 2014 (<a title="Review of Queen of the Tearling" href="http://nikkilizmurray.com/2015/01/11/review-of-queen-of-the-tearling/">here</a>), but here are some of the highlights, in no particular order!

<!--more-->

<em>The Lunar Chronicles (Cinders, Scarlet, Cress)</em> -  - Marissa Meyer - This is candy, but it's pretty good candy. It's part Sailor Moon fanfiction, part "fairy tails re-told" and also part post-apocalyptic-ish.

<em>The Summer Prince -  </em>Alaya Dawn Johnson - Race, class, and age play a huge part in this novel. Future matriarchal Brazil with a poly, queer love triangle and a protagonist with a bisexual mother? Please!

<em>The Drowning Girl - </em>Caitlin Kiernan - Possibly triggering! Possibly a ghost story, possibly the story of a woman's battle with a mental illness, definitely has a trans woman as one of the main characters.<em>
</em>

<em>Scale-Bright - </em><span class="st">Benjanun Sriduangkaew - Both prose and poetry, a twist on Chinese myth with lots of lesbians, and straddling both heaven and earth, human and in-. </span><em>
</em>

<em>The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Making - </em>Catherynne M. Valente - A very dangerous Fairyland, with a heroine who learns to stand on her own and an obligatory magical creature cast.<em>
</em>

<em>The Girl Who Fell Beneath Fairyland and Lead the Revels There - </em>Catherynne M. Valente - Like the first of the series, but with some interesting subtext and text about the importance of consent.<em>
</em>

<em>Howls Moving Castle  - </em>Diane Wynne Jones- Re-read - Still as fun as the first time I read it, still infinitely more rich than that Miyazaki film.

<em>Hundred Thousand Kingdoms</em> - N.K. Jemisin -Re-read - If gods fashioned humans after themselves, how fucked up must gods be? Even knowing the answer beforehand, I was still shocked on the re-read.

<em>Seven Things Cadet Blanchard Learned from the Trade Summit Incident</em> - Annalee Flower Horne -Short Story - Clever, hilarious, plus fart jokes. Good world building, and believably done in few words. An evil company, a smart cadet, and fart jokes.

<em>One True Love</em> - Malinda Lo - Short Story - Heart-wrenching. I was getting my hair done when I read it, so I couldn't tear my hair out during the sad part. Plus, lesbians, an evil step-dad, and a damsel in the tower!

On my list for this year, for those who want to read along with me:

Seraphina, Alcestis, Fairest, Ascension, The Archer Who Shot Down the Suns, The Girl Who Soared Over Fairyland and Cut the Moon in Two, Re-Read: Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, Grave Mercy, The Killing Moon, The Goldfinch, Shadow and Bone, Re-Read the Girl of Fire and Thorns, Re-Read: Liliths Brood, Adaptation, and any other things my friends/family may publish! Ooops...that list is so far also not containing men...Also taking suggestions in the comments!
