I am working on two reviews right now, one for "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SVWX5TM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00SVWX5TM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nikkmurr-20&amp;linkId=COUODSAS3WWIYHA3">Second Position</a>" and one for "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P2WO2M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B003P2WO2M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=nikkmurr-20&amp;linkId=5RNY2WOQZGGL6TI3">Shades of Milk and Honey</a>"! However, I do have bills to pay, and unfortunately my apartment does not understand why I should put money toward books first, and rent second.

I own my own domain, and pay for hosting. I must pay for the books I read, as I want to support these authors and sometimes the local libraries are dreadfully slow in purchasing books by marginalized authors. I am setting up a Patreon to help support these costs in reviewing books. My reviews will still be freely available here. They will first be available on Patreon, though. You can contribute as little as $1 per review. I am hoping to do more frequent reviews, but most likely never more than 5 a month.

If you are interested in supporting me in reviewing books, please head over to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NikkiMurray">Patreon</a>. My coding and feminism posts are not part of this effort, and will be available here still, for free.Â  I am working on my own app to recommend books featuring diverse main characters. If you want to support that, please either donate via paypal (on my about page) or check out my code on my github and get in touch about contributing.

You may have noticed I set up an amazon store, too. Please feel free to browse through and purchase books from the review's I've posted, and other books by those authors.
