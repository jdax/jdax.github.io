        <h2 style="color: white;">
          The birthright of every Ástfríður is to know each metal in the earth, command it, bend it to their desires. To
          hear metal singing, some of it waiting just beneath the surface, so much of it deeper in the earth. If they
          wanted, they knew they could pluck that metal from the earth, melt it with a thought, and shape it as they
          pleased with a breath of air and their will. While they can all call upon any metal, they each choose one as
          their own, denoting the path they wish to walk in life.</h2>

        <h2 style="color: white;">The Veil of the Ástfríður has kept them hidden from the world, and safe from
          intruders. Yet Britt and Astrid feel they are imposters in their own homes.

        <h1>A sweeping LGBTQ and polyamorous retelling of "Swan Lake"!</h1>
        <br/>

        <h2 style="color: white;">"I loved the queer-positive fairy tale world, but I was pleasantly surprised to find
          that was only the backdrop for a subtle story about trust, betrayal, and new possibilities. I highly recommend
          it, even if you're not familiar with the original story!"<br/> - Danika,
