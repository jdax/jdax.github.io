I wanted to take a few moments to discuss how I got into coding and what I'm doing so far/have learned so far! A way long back, in high school, my computer science teacher decided teaching HTML was way more important than going on and on and on and on about Microsoft Office. So we built a website, and we made pac-man. Of course, I only used these skills for the most pure of purposes: a fan-site with auto-play music dedicated to <em>The Last Unicorn</em>.

Fast-forward ten years, and I somehow end up at a ruby meet up and am soon writing a small program to make my cats cuddles with each other (something they do on command in this program, something they do only when the fancy strikes them in real life). I start playing around on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a>, and decide I want to get serious about this. Since then I've been vacillating between <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a>, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, and <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>. I'll be attending <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/back-end-web-development">General Assembly's Back-End Web Development</a> course in two weeks!

So far through the various means I've learned a bit more HTML, a lot of CSS, JavaScript, and picked up bits here and there of how Ruby differs from other programing languages. I've learned how to use command line better, the importance of version control, git and gitHub, that "cat" has nothing to do with cats, the animals, and everything to do with concatenating.

I'll be posting later about the various tutorials/guides I've been using, what I liked and didn't like, problems I got stuck on, and questions that baffled me (still baffle me?).
