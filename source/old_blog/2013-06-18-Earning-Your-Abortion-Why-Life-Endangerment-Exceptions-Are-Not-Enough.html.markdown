A little while back, I tweeted that if I became pregnant, I would need an abortion to save my life.

I received not a small number of people flat out telling me I deserved to die, and a larger number of people demanding my medical records so they could judge for themselves if am abortion was really necessary. None of these people were doctors, yet they all demanded a say in my medical treatment.

Still others wanted to know my sexual history; some deemed me too slutty, and even though I am now in a monogamous marriage, my past sexual history made my right to life null and void. 

Further yet, there were some who tried to teach me about birth control. I spend my days teaching people about sexual and reproductive health, and found this amusing. After I explained that me and my spouse use multiple methods, I thought I had at least "earned my abortion" from these folks. But no, they moved the goal post and said I should get sterilized. When I explained that it is a long, expensive process, this became to them, "just an excuse to kill your baby" and I clearly wasn't trying hard enough to prevent a life threatening pregnancy, therefore I deserved to die.

This is why banning abortion in all cases except for the life of the person who is pregnant will never work. There will always be someone who doesn't think your life is in danger enough. Or someone who might believe you will die, but sees your death as appropriate punishment.
