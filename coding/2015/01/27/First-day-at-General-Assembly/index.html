            <p>Last night was my first night at General Assembly's back end web development course. The weather attempted to stop it, but despite the impending blizzard and the ice and snow it threw at us, we were able to have class as planned.</p>

<p>The various staff of GA introduced themselves, and explained how they could help us. I'm not very good at names/faces, so we will see how well I do when I need to actually ask for something!</p>

<p>We started off with an explanation of what the internet is, and how it works. For the purposes of retaining information, I will be regurgitating some of it here. SORRY NOT SORRY.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It was explained to us by steps. There is a user, who sits in front of a computer. This computer is connected to a modem or a wifi hotspot. This connects to the internet, the maintenance of which is up to the service providers. It is then connected to the server of the website the user is trying to get to. A server is just a fancy word for a computer that runs the programs/codes. The internet sends you to the server via the domain name. Every domain name is assigned to an IP address which points to that server. The controller at the server gets the model, which is connected to a database, and a view. So a user types in www.domainname.com/specific_page and that request is sent through the previously explained path. The internet handles the domain name, the server handles the /specific_page part (which is called a route). Once that request is recieved, the server sends a response, and a webpage appears in the browser.</p>

<p>Since this is a "back end" course, it will focus on the part after the internet sends the request to the server.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, we moved into using the command line in a unix OS. I've already done a lot with command line via <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations" target="_blank">treehouse </a>and this was mostly a review for me. However, the exercise we did was much much more geeky. It involved creating the directories of Alderaan, and Deathstar, and putting .voice's on Alderaan and vader on the deathstar and force removing the Alderaan directory. Well, yes. I suppose as long as we have equal representation of Star Wars and Star Trek in our exercises I'll be fine. Once we were all comfortable with the basic's of the command line, we moved on to learning Ruby!</p>

<p>This was also a review for me, having gone through a lot of online classes and tutorials in Ruby. We went over strings, numbers, booleans, and variables. The instructors said that this fast pace was designed to make us learn, to extend ourselves, and to develop a "growth mind-set." If I wasn't already familiar with these concepts I might have felt a little overwhelmed. If you are a raw beginner and have never even looked at an intro to programming, I might suggest doing so before taking this course.</p>

<p>There was an install fest on Sunday, which I had to miss because sometimes you totally mis-understand how a car sharing app works, and sometimes the support person can't help you when the car itself is broke. It seemed to be ok, though. I already had RVM, Rails, and Sublime Text 3 on my linux machine, and luckily I already had the one gem they wanted to use yesterday (pry, the gem is pry and it is a really cool gem that lets you stop the code after a certain point to see how it works; we just used it to play around with strings and variables and booleans).</p>

<p>I'm hoping there isn't going to be much boolean. Or maybe I am hoping there will be a bi more, as I'm not very good at the logic part of boolean. I didn't take a logic class in college, I took an epistemology class (I'm still waiting for it to be applicable in life, but to be fair I'm still waiting for a lot of my courses to be applicable.)</p>

<p>Since I last posted, I also created a twitter bot that posts pictures of my cats: @NikkisCats - I'm getting around to posting a blogpost about it as soon as I get it on github. Please look forward to it!</p>
