            <p>I did a brief review of the Lunar Chronicles in my post about my unintentional year of not reading men. As you may recall, I'm purposefully not reading men this year. This is becoming difficult as I get more into the tech field and I want to read some "pinnacle" books. So far I've been immersing myself in Sandi Metz's Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby, and stalling on coming to a decision about cheats. In fiction, though, I've had no problems meeting my goals.</p>

<p>I've had "Fairest" pre-ordered on Amazon since it was announced. My friend <a title="Pairing Wine and Candy" href="http://www.uncorkedunwrapped.com" target="_blank">Liz</a> introduced me to the Lunar Chronicle books about a year ago, conveniently when "Cress" had just been released so I did not have to wait at all after finishing "Scarlet" to find out what happens next. This was a relief after my childhood was spent waiting for the next Harry Potter. And then I found out Fairest would come out next, I was both elated and dejected. I had to wait longer to find out what would become of Kai and Cinder? Unfair. A chance to find out why Levana was a royal pain and learn more of Cinder's origins and her mothers past? Yes please!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Obligatory spoiler warning for small plot points you might find on the dust jacket.</p>

<p>I was expecting an answer to why Levana hated mirrors, why she wore her veil, why she tried, and later realized she failed at, killing her niece and how her sister died. I was expecting a story that would make her sympathetic, that would give good reasons why she did what she did. I was expecting a story about wrong deeds done for the right reasons. Why else would one write about a villain if not to add some sympathy. The trend of sympathetic villains can be recently exemplified with the extensive re-writes of Frozen and the actual final version of Malificent. Seeing as Levana is a mash up of Queen Beryl from Sailor Moon and Snow White's evil Step Mother, I was expecting to see a similar tragic story told to justify why she became the way she is.</p>

<p>I did find a tragic story, however, it made me hate Levana more than I already did. While her sister, Cinder's mother, was not portrayed as a saint or savior of Luna (unlike Queen Serenity) she was at least not a murderess. Levana's entire world is being the second daughter of the King and Queen of an extravagant and frivolous court. While her father may have had eyes on long term plans to invade and conquer Earth in an attempt to remedy the problem of dwindling natural lunar resources, the court is otherwise involved in the luxury of glamors and illusion. When they are murdered by 'shells' she finds herself as next in line to the thrown.</p>

<p>Her sister dedicates herself to quickly securing an heir to supplant Levana by means of sleeping with a number of men and keeping the father of her child a mystery. She is thus able to cultivate alliances among a number of families, each being lead to believe the heir is partially of their blood line. This bit of politiking serves a court reminiscent of Henry VIII but does not solve the problems Levana is convinced only she sees.</p>

<p>From the start of the story Levana has a crush on a man who is, inconveniently, married and expecting a child soon. Through a series of coincidental events, the wife dies and leaves a newborn child behind. Levana sees this as fate and uses coercion and mind control to attempt to make this man truly fall in love with her. She forces him to marry her, and he attempts to make the best of it to secure safety for his daughter. Levana adopts this child as a stepdaughter and makes her a princess. She is a playmate for the young Cinder.</p>

<p>Soon after, Levana's sister also coincidentally dies. While we the readers know that none of the convenient deaths til now have been Levana's orchestration, it does not phase Levana at all. I was expecting guilt at the death of her husbands first wife, I was expecting grief at the loss of her sister. Was this not supposed to be a tragic villain back story? Were these events not supposed to motivate her later tyrannical rule?</p>

<p>I was not a fan of the ways in which Levana attempted to manipulate and control her husband, it was uncomfortable to read. She had power over him in ways that don't include her Lunar Gift. He was a palace guard, and she was a princess. She was his employer, she was able to banish him. She had the ability to have him locked up. She reminded him of this constantly. The entire relationship is abusive and he has no escape. She was a tyrant from the start.</p>

<p>With her sister dead, she assumes the crown as a regent until her niece is old enough to rule on her own. Levana enjoys this power, and uses it as she thinks is best for the kingdom. She slowly realizes that as her niece grows up, her time as ruler is closer to an end. She uses her Gift to manipulate a nurse into catching her nieces room on fire, securing her step-daughter first. Her husband almost immediately sees through this, as do many others. Levana, rightfully, is convinced of a plot that might have lead to the continued survival of her niece, and orchestrates a hunt for anyone who might have had part in it. At this point in the story, this is expected. A combination of us, the readers, knowing Cinder is alive and well and exactly how she escaped, and also the fact that so far every decision of Levana's reveals her cruelty to us, makes this plot point obvious.</p>

<p>The only thing I was left wondering was, if the first book starts with Levana wanting to marry Kai, what happened to her husband? She might not love him, but she certain is possessive of him. The one surprise in this book was the way in which she meticulously planned his death, and that it was so she could be free to make a more political marriage.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the book. I was glad it wasn't a sympathetic re-telling of Queen Beryl/Evil Queen from Snow White.  We've had a lot of those recently. It wasn't as good, in my opinion, as <em>Cinder</em> and I am really wanting to know the conclusion to the story. If you are recommending these books to someone, I suggest a <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> treatment, read this one first.</p>
